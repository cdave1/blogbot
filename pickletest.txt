V<span>A talkfest is underway on how to waste rates in Orklund this week and I do not hold much hope for any progress.  Especially when I see comments like this<br /></span><span><blockquote>The really interesting issue for me is that we haven't fully quantified the problem and fully identified what it is that Wellington is hoping to achieve by the [commission]. We are still not grasping the real issue...</blockquote></span><br /><span>Interesting that a councillor elected on a red ticket is working on the premise that any final outcome needs to match what Liarbour deems needs to be achieved.  <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490635">Why bother</a>?<br /><br />This confirms the suspected MO, that the commission is just being an excuse to head off livid ratepayers in an election year.<br /><br />Here's my view of some extremely quantifiable bits to help her on her way<br /></span><ul><li>Rates are too high</li><li>Bureaucracy at local government is rampant</li><li>8 councils to run one city is not on</li><li>Between council turf wars</li><li>Infrastructure massively underfunded</li><li>Councils playing social engineers</li><li>Cost plus regime for ratepayers using services they have already paid for<br /></li></ul>and the fix<br /><ul><li>Major infrastructure should be fully funded from central government</li><li>One council to run the whole city, ending parochial wars</li><li>Wield a knife in the bureaucracy</li><li>Gut social engineering and public transport from local government</li><li>Arterial roading to be fully funded from central government<br /></li><li>Council to stick to managing parks, local roads, local water/sewerage, rubbish collection</li><li>Ditch all rates input into sports stadia and the like</li><li>Stop the twin-cities waste of rates</li><li>One set of rules for all cultures</li><li>No second airport<br /></li></ul>Unfortunately, I suspect my grandchildren will be having this same discussion.  It has been going on for 4 decades that I know of and still has not been addresssed.

V<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/2244575587_ce6fa6dfb4_o.gif" />Clavardon, from the French for "to chat," is the latest from Canadian-based \u000Acompany <a href="http://www.sosign.com/">Sosign</a>. The product, launched in late 2007,&nbsp; is a tool for co-browsing \u000Aof e-commerce web sites, which means it's essentially another way to do social \u000Ashopping. However, unlike some other social shopping services, <a href="http://www.clavardon.com/">Clavardon</a> is a tool \u000Athat adds a layer to any existing web site to provide the co-browsing \u000Afunctionality. The solution offers some unique features that provide real-time \u000Ainteraction between its users. Shoppers can co-browse with each other or with the \u000Aweb site's sales manager in the virtual store.  \u000A\u000A<p>In this way, Clavardon is more like a live support solution, but one that \u000Aoffers more functionality than most. The tool offers the ability for users to \u000Aco-browse and chat with each other, but it also offers things like co-scrolling, \u000Awhere user's can control each other's interaction on a page, co-highlighting, \u000Awhere one user could highlight a section of the page for the others to see, and \u000Ajoint form filling, where different users can input information into the same \u000Aform. \u000A</p><p>This type of interaction could be useful for those who want to shop together, \u000Abut it seems like it may be even more useful to promote interaction between site \u000Aowners and visitors. In this way, the service is not only beneficial to general \u000Aconsumers who want to shop with their friends, but it could also be utilized in a \u000Abusiness environment. \u000A</p><p>It's easy to imagine site owners using the tool to provide instructional \u000Atours or training to their new customers on how to use their web site. For \u000Aexample, an office supply company could demonstrate how to use search, shopping \u000Alists, and checkout to all the office managers in a particular company at the \u000Asame time. The visitors could respond with feedback and questions as the \u000Ainstruction was provided, leading to a better comprehension of what a particular \u000Acompany's web site had to offer.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2112/2245368958_411a520f8b_o.png" /></p><p>The tool is a solely commercial product that is marketed to e-commerce site \u000Aowners at a base price of $199 per month. This allows for an unlimited number of \u000Ausers and up to 500 sessions per month. A 15-day free trial version is available \u000A<a href="http://www.clavardon.com/order.en.html?package=0">here</a> or you can get a taste of what Clavardon is like by trying the <a href="http://www.clavardon.com/demo.en.html">online demo</a>. \u000A</p><p>Since the tool is so good for providing live support, the "shop with friends" \u000Aaspect seems to be more of a secondary feature. Although possible, there are \u000A<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_shopping_faceoff.php">plenty of other social shopping services</a> that provide more features in that \u000Aarea. \u000A</p><p>However, live support and chat features are incredibly useful in today's \u000Afast-paced world where we don't have time to wait for an email back from \u000Asupport. A tool like Clavardon improves upon the live support offerings that are \u000Aalready available to allow for a more personalized and social experience. That \u000Aalone makes the product notable and worth a look. </p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=0Tg3uU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=0Tg3uU" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=4pFAudE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=4pFAudE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=lHlbhME"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=lHlbhME" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=z0PbG8e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=z0PbG8e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=LKiOlre"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=LKiOlre" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=rhYQrOe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=rhYQrOe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=lxcFCoE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=lxcFCoE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=YxgQT2E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=YxgQT2E" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229900226" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>DPF <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/02/the_cost_of_carbon_mitigation.html">makes a lot of noise</a> about a <a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/features/NZBR%20PEPANZ%20Carbon%20Mitigation%20Scenarios.pdf">Business Round Table-commissioned study</a> [PDF] which claims that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2025 would <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=26&objectid=10490750&ref=rss">"cost each household $19,000 a year"</a>.  DPF regards this as proof positive that the costs of mitigation are too high, and that therefore we should not bother at all to do anything about emissions.  Meanwhile, Hot Topic looks at the report and finds that it is a <a href="http://hot-topic.co.nz/2008/02/05/they-would-say-that-again-wouldnt-they/">strapped chicken</a>:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>But, as is usual with these things, when you look at the assumptions that underpin the forecast, you find that they have been carefully designed to produce the result the sponsors wanted. Take a look at the method used (see PDF linked above): they define a \u201Cbusiness as usual\u201D case against which they will measure the costs of emissions reductions - and they shoot for GDP growth of 4.5 - 5% per annum. I don\u2019t have the figures to hand, but I can\u2019t think of any period in the recent past when GDP growth has been that high - and certainly not for 17 successive years. And the costs? They use very high carbon prices (up to $300/tonne). So, when you artificially inflate both long term growth and the costs of action, you discover that action\u2019s expensive.\u000A\u000A<p>Why am I not surprised?</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000AThis is a classic spindoctor's trick - assume fantasy growth rates, then let the miracle of compound interest do its work - so its no real surprise that the spindoctor has fallen for it.  But the idea that this would be considered credible in the real world is just laughable.  \u000A\u000A<p>For those who are interested, the difference between the BRT's "business as usual" growth scenario of 4.9% per year and a more realistic one of 3% (the trend for the last decade, widely considered to be the best long run of growth New Zealand has had since the 60's, so probably too high on average) is about 27% of final economic output.  Which is pretty much their "result" right there.\u000A\u000A<p><i>Update:</i> I have misrepresented DPF in this post; see my <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2008/02/correction-and-apology.html">correction and apology</a>.

The National Party has criticised the Government stance over the state-owned broadcast and telecommunications business's contract in military-ruled Myanmar.<br />National foreign affairs spokesman Murray McCully said it was contradictory that the Government had no problem with Kordia's contract when it had "tantrums" over Air New Zealand carrying Australian troops to the Iraq war.</i><br /><br />Hmmm, couple of things \u2013 Trev it is slightly hypercritical, and your claim that it\u2019s okay because there are no current economic sanctions against Myanmar isn\u2019t any defence, other countries have placed sanctions, so should we. Murray \u2013 mate, you the Dark Lord of the Sith complaining about ethics and hypocrisy? Oh come on, how did you keep a straight face during that interview on TV? Interestingly enough, in a Freakonomics kinda way, once mobile phone use reaches 15% of a population it is very difficult for dictatorships to keep control of a population as the transfer of independent news and information cancels out the power of state created media.

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/mowserlogo.jpg" />Telephony-head Russell Beattie added an <a href="http://m.mowser.com/mp3/portishead">MP3 search and download feature</a> to his mobile service <em>Mowser</em> tonight, powered by music search engine <a href="http://www.seeqpod.com/">SeeqPod</a>.  The service makes it remarkably easy to search for, download and listen to any song online.   All. From. Your. Phone.  It's nice.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>This is just one of a number of "powered by SeeqPod" announcements you'll likely be seeing if you are interested in music search.  Josh Lowensohn <a href="http://music.download.com/8301-5_32-9864445-13.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=Crossfade">reported on yet another</a>, called <a href="http://songerize.com/">Songerize</a>, today.  Enjoy the music and the API action while you can, because SeeqPod is too good to be true and is headed for court.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>It turns out that <a href="http://www.seeqpod.com/blog/?p=19">Warner Music Group is suing SeeqPod</a>.  As Mike Miner blogs at <a href="http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/theagenda/index.cfm?page_id=3&action=blog&subaction=viewpost&blog_id=81&post_id=6766&CFID=168467&CFTOKEN=25327961">The Agenda</a>:<br />\u000A<blockquote>Maybe it's just too beautiful to live. Warner Music Group is suing Seeqpod, the finest music site I've seen on the internet, because it allows people to scour the net for music, put it in a playlist and play it for free. Naturally, not all the music files it finds has dotted all its copyright i's or crossed many legal t's.</blockquote></p>\u000A\u000A<p>For now, if you're looking for a good web page mobilizer - much less an mobile MP3 search engine, check out <a href="http://m.mowser.com">Mowser</a>.

According to the <em>Dominion Post</em><br /><br /><blockquote>She was arrested yesterday and is in the cells at Auckland Central police station.</blockquote>Millie's bail terms have not been made public, but in cases involving drug abuse the terms usually include regular drug testing and attendance at rehabilition. Could she have failed one of her regularly scheduled drug tests or is it a case of her getting back together with her old drug mates? We hear that Millie is still spending time with people with known links to drugs, but all will be revealed tomorrow. So far, the news is that "she breached bail by associating with a woman who was with her at the time of her arrest".<br /><br />Bail terms can include restrictions on the times and places a bailee can go gadding about, and the people they mix with. In past reports, Millie has <a href="http://www.nzrealitytv.com/2007/12/millie-holmes-drug-sentence-deferred.html">talked about having a curfew</a> which was recently extended to allow her to socialise until the pumpkin hour.<br /><br />Millie will be back in court on Thursday morning, no doubt accompanied by a hundred bloodthirsty reporters and devoted daddy (shhh, don't let him hear you call him Millie's stepfather) <a href="http://www.nzrealitytv.com/search/label/Paul%20Holmes">Paul Holmes</a>, but will mum Hinemoa Elder come out of her self-imposed exile on Waiheke Island to support her troubled daughter?<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.netguide.co.nz/Home/MagazineEvents/WebAwards/tabid/64/Default.aspx"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157857497812717906" alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_HZlxBZQcoGI/R5RkERc2UVI/AAAAAAAABco/1sFeq6wOweQ/s400/WebAwards_2008_468x60_01.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />If you enjoy reading this blog, please vote for us in the <a href="http://www.netguide.co.nz/Home/MagazineEvents/WebAwards/tabid/64/Default.aspx">Best Blog category of the NetGuide People's Choice Awards</a>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?a=oN1mfo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?i=oN1mfo" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=PQpzrjE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=PQpzrjE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=ZPb8pee"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=ZPb8pee" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=HAXhrLe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=HAXhrLe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=DekaHde"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=DekaHde" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewZealandRealityTv/~4/229835736" height="1" width="1" />

That will come as a shock to doting pet lovers who like to overfeed their dog with treats and leftovers!<br /><br />In <span>It's Me Or The Dog: Fat Dog Special</span>, Victoria's got her sights set on transforming three porky pooches into honed hounds. There's Hattie, the huge Beagle who steals food from the bins and kitchen counter. Next up is Gizmo, the chunky Chihuahua whose owner dotes on him so much that she hand-feeds her little darling Indian takeaways and chocolates. Lastly, there's Jess the dumpy Daschund whose belly is dragging along the floor and whose owner is dragging her heels when it comes to changing her dog's diet.<br /><br />With advice on diet and exercise, as well as medical implications from vet Marc Abrahams, Victoria has to make these owners see the damage they are doing to their pets, before it's too late.

V<p><img border="0" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/vote-button.jpg" width="100" height="99" />Today is so-called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Duper_Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a>" in the US.  Voters in 24 states are heading to the polls -- including in large population states like New York, California, and Illinois -- to decide who get to face off for the job of US president as the nominees of the Republican and Democratic parties.  After the votes have been counted tonight, 52% of the Democratic and 41% of the Republican delegates will have been awarded, and it may be that we have a clearer picture of who those nominees are.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Following election returns from 24 states can be overwhelming, though.  Certainly it is interesting and it can be a lot of fun (especially for political junkies), but that's a lot of data to absorb in a very short time.  Thankfully, there are a number of tools on the web to make election watching easier.  Below are some of our favorites.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/">CNN Election Center 2008</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>In our opinion, CNN has by far the slickest and easiest to navigate election site out of all the major mainstream news media sources.  They have a well designed, easy to navigate, and clearly laid out page that puts a wealth of information at your fingertips, including live election results, delegate counts, entrance and exit polls, candidate overviews, money charts, and general election info.  If you're looking for just the straight state-by-state results, <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/results-all.aspx">USA Today</a> does a great job.</a></p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://politweets.com/">Politweets</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Politweets is our favorite Twitter politics mashup.  <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/politweets_twittering_politics.php">Last month</a> we said that, "For political junkies, Politweet will be a must monitor web-site on every primary date this season until we know who the candidates for the general election are."  Assuming Twitter can keep the lights on, Politweets will again be a must watch site throughout the day. Also check out the <a href="http://twitter.com/SuperTuesday">SuperTuesday</a> Twitter stream from the <a href="http://www.virtualvantagepoints.com/">Virtual Vantage Points</a> blog.</p> \u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/be-part-of-super-tuesday-action.html">Google Super Tuesday Map</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>In an effort to make sure Twitter goes down, Google has also teamed up with the service to create a maps mashup that shows Twitter updates about the primaries as they come in from across the country.  It will display election results down to the county level after the returns are in, as well.  The Google News team also slapped together an election gadget so you can embed  state-by-state results on your web page.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img border="0" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/google-suptuesmap.jpg" width="610" height="420" /></p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/supertuesday">YouTube YouChoose Super Tuesday</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>YouTube has a Google Maps mashup of their own that will aggregate and post geolocated videos throughout the day from candidates, news organizations, and YouTubers.  The coverage isn't really restricted to Super Tuesday states, but it is still worth checking out -- many times the citizen journalist view is clearer than the one you get via mainstream sources.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://think.mtv.com/Issues/politics/">MTV Choose or Lose Street Team</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Speaking of citizen journalism, MTV's Street Team has citizen journalists dispatched to 23 Super Tuesday states to upload live and recorded mobile videos and blog posts throughout the day (absent is a representative from West Virginia, whose primary is actually May 13 -- the Republican party is awarding some delegates today via a statewide convention, however).  Last week we called MTV's online election coverage a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mtv_election_coverage_citizen_journalism.php">coup for citizen journalism</a>.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/94616">Newsweek Live Webcast: Inside Super Tuesday</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>If mainstream journalism is more your thing, then Newsweek has you covered on the web.  The magazine, along with owner the Wasington Post, is trotting out the heavy hitters for six continuous hours of live streaming web video coverage.  Bob Woodward, Ben Bradlee, Sally Quinn, Howard Kurtz, and Leonard Downie will participate, with Newsweek editor Jon Meacham anchoring from Washingtonpost.com's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.   WaPo and Newsweek reporters Michael Isikoff, Howard Fineman, Jonathan Alter, and others, including those from online magazine Slate, will contribute reports throughout the evening.  Newsweek's operation is aiming to bring the name appeal and polish of broadcast news to the web.  We'll see if it works.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2><a href="http://www.memeorandum.com/">Memeorandum</a></h2>\u000A\u000A<p>From the maker of Techmeme, Gabe Rivera's political memetracker keeps a pulse on the political blogosphere.  It's a safe bet everyone will be buzzing about Super Tuesday today, but what are the individual storylines that will no doubt permeate the coverage?  Following the related and discussion links on Memeorandum will let you find out.

VSo, no surprise here, I travel to work\u000Aon the tube. It's fantastic - especially all the sub-second glimpses of things I get\u000Aas we fly past some likely forgotten station or mainenance area. It still captivates\u000Ame. (offtopic: anyone know of an underground tour of London?)<br /><br />\u000AHowever, the tube is two things: noisey and dirty. Dirty I can handle - blow my nose\u000Awhen I get out, and I'm sorted, tho I'm told being in the tube for 2 hours a day (which\u000AI am) is like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_air_pollution">smoking\u000Aa cigarette or three</a>. Oh, well. I think I can live with that.<br /><br />\u000AThe noise polution, however, is something else. It's LOUD in there. So loud, that\u000Awith the usual iPod headphones (which let in a lot of external noise), I have to crank\u000Athe volume up to almost 100%. When I'm not in the tube, this volume is close to unbareable.\u000AThrow in a RPM session at the gym at work, and my ears are ringing by the end of the\u000Aday.<br /><br />\u000AI own a pair of Blackbox M14's, which I use mostly when I'm on planes or in an aircon'ed\u000Aoffice, as the noise cancelling is really good. However, they are not really suitable\u000Afor use on the tube - they are large, obvious, and not overly portable. So I went\u000Ahunting for a replacement pair.<br /><br />\u000AThe options I came up with were:<br /><ul><li>\u000AA pair of C14's from blackbox. I dont like earbuds with attached circuit boxes, so\u000Athey were removed from the list quickly - same with other makes with the same setup.\u000AThey are around $170 NZ, which is around 60£. So the price is good....</li><li>\u000ASee what I can find in the apple store.</li></ul>\u000ASo, I took option #2. Actually, I wanted to see if they had the Macbook Air in the\u000Astore (they dont), and I have to go thru Oxford Circus anyway to get home, and the\u000Aapple store is about 100m from the tube enterance.... (cue self-justification now)<br /><br />\u000AAfter looking around, there were various ones in my price range - Sennheiser, Bose\u000A(well, just out of my price range), Shure, JBL, and a few others. They come in three\u000A"formats" - clip on's which sit ON the ear; clipons which sit IN the ear, and buds\u000Awhich sit IN the ear. As I wanted to eliminate the outside noise, the IN the ear ones\u000Awere the best option. I would have gone for the Shure above any of the others, excep\u000Athe price is crazy. 170-350£!? WTF! Rod loves his, but sadly I dont (yet) have his\u000Abank balance.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.harmanaudio.com/images/products/front_large/JBLREF220BLK-H.jpg" height="240" width="320" /><br /><br />\u000ATo cut a short story shorter, I went for the JBL's - <a href="http://www.jbl.com/home/products/product_detail.aspx?prod=JBLREF220BLK-H&Language=ENG&Country=GB&Region=EUROPE&cat=MME&ser=HMM&featureid=12362">the\u000A220 Reference model</a> to be specific (<a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=4B9033F6&nplm=TL122">£50\u000Aat the Apple Store</a>). They are small, black (which means I'm not screaming "I have\u000Aan ipod!"), sit in the ear canal and block out almost ALL external noise, and come\u000Awith wrap-around-the-ear bits, as well as being free-standing. Why does no-one else\u000Ado this? This means I can have them as normal ear buds when I'm on the tube (most\u000Aof the time), but have them held onto my ears when I'm at the gym. Best of both worlds.<br /><br />\u000AThe best thing about them is that now <b>I can have the volume at around 40%</b> and\u000Ahear it clearly on the tube. Before, <b>it was at around 90-100%</b>. Even after just\u000Aone day of using them, the ringing in my ears is calming down. And thats gotta be\u000Agood for me.<br /><p></p><br /><hr />\u000A[ <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nicwise">Flickr Photos</a> | <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicwise">LinkedIn\u000AProfile</a> ]<br />\u000AThe opinions in this blog are mine.

VThe <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490884">PM should not be expressing surprise</a>.  Yesterday's <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490918">welcome</a> for John Key is just another expression of the increasingly close relationship between the two parties, and between the Harawira family and National in particular.  This has been a consistent theme to The Hive's reporting.

The latest, commissioned by the Business Roundtable and the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association (Pepanz) from Adolf Stroombergen at Infometrics, is a fine example of the latter. The numbers allow Roger Kerr to rumble ominously [<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4388528a13.html" target="_top">Stuff</a>, <span><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=26&objectid=10490750&ref=rss" target="_top">Herald</a></span>, original BR press release (<a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/releases/0204CarbonNeutralityMR.pdf">PDF</a>)]:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p>\u000A  <span>"The impact on numerous industries would be devastating - reductions in output of the order of 30 per cent to 40 per cent are reported in the case of sheep and dairy farming - and major industrial firms could face complete closure," Mr Kerr said.</span>\u000A</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Even worse, households could be $19,000 a year worse off by 2025 and the government would still fail to meet a notional target of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2025. Sounds dire. Better do nothing&nbsp;then...</p>\u000A<p>But, as is usual with these things, when you look at the assumptions that underpin the forecast, you find that they have been carefully designed to produce the result the sponsors wanted. Take a look at the method used (see PDF linked above): they define a "business as usual" case against which they will measure the costs of emissions reductions - and they shoot for GDP growth of 4.5 - 5% per annum. I don't have the figures to hand, but I can't think of any period in the recent past when GDP growth has been that high - and certainly not for 17 successive years. And the costs? They use very high carbon prices (up to $300/tonne). So, when you artificially inflate both long term growth and the costs of action, you discover that action's&nbsp;expensive.</p>\u000A<p>Why am I not&nbsp;surprised?</p>\u000A<p>And I'm not entirely surprised by news (<a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200802041834/iwi_leaders_oppose_climate-change_bill" target="_top">Radio NZ</a>) that 15 iwi leaders, chaired by Tuku Morgan and meeting at the Waitangi Treaty grounds say they oppose all climate-change legislation - because it has no regard for Treaty rights. But I'd like to know more about why. Forestry interests are one thing, geothermal sensitivies another, but what are the Treaty&nbsp;implications?</p>

V<p>The government has <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490754">signed a deal with Ngati Porou to recognise their territorial customary rights over the foreshore and seabed in their tribal rohe</a>.  While I <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2004/11/final-words-on-foreshore-and-seabed.html">opposed</a> the Foreshore and Seabed Act as an attack on due process and equality under the law, I still think this is good news.  At the same time, it also demonstrates perfectly the tragedy of the foreshore and seabed.  \u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>When the agreement is finalised, it will require legal recognition of Ngati Porou's territorial customary rights.\u000A\u000A<p>The agreement will ensure Ngati Porou's status is recorded in official documents and is taken into account in consent processes under the Resource Management Act and Marine Reserves Act.\u000A\u000A<p>It will also require the Government to consult with Ngati Porou on issues such as fisheries and conservation in the East Cape coastal area.\u000A\u000A<p>There will also be a protection for specified customary rights and the ability to block resource consents which would affect the coastal customary rights areas.\u000A\u000A<p>The Government and the iwi are yet finalise details of the agreement including the location of territorial customary rights areas and the collection of evidence to back the claims.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000AReading this, the overwhelming feeling is that this is exactly the sort of settlement crown and iwi would have been discussing if the law had not been passed and iwi had been free to contest ownership through the courts.  So instead of having a few court cases short-circuited by negotiation and mutual settlement, we've had them short-circuited by law and a denial of fundamental human rights - with consequent feelings of betrayal and mistrust - to achieve pretty much the same result.  In what universe could that possibly be considered a good outcome?\u000A\u000A<p>By legislating in panic, the government has made its job harder.  Not only does it have to reach the same settlements it would have reached anyway; it also has to deal with the legacy of mistrust it has created.  We're all going to be paying for that mistake for some time to come.

V<p><img border="0" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/ballot-box.jpg" width="110" height="113" />There's no question this year that Barack Obama and Ron Paul are the kings of US politics on the Internet.  They both command the <a href="http://blog.compete.com/election2008/">lion's share of their party's attention</a> online and seem to dominate social networking and social media sites.  So why is only one of those campaigns actually working?  How come only Obama has been able to translate his online success to success at the polls?  We thought we'd take a brief look today at the Obama campaign and why it has been successful, while citizens in 24 US states head to the polls as part of "Super Tuesday."</p>\u000A<p><i><b>UPDATE:</b> Also check out <b><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/keeping_tabs_on_super_tuesday.php">Keeping Tabs on Super Tuesday</a></b>, our guide to following Super Tuesday via the Internet.</i></p>\u000A\u000A<p>Last week Obama's campaign announced that it had raised $32 million in January alone, a <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/02/01/obama_sets_new_online_record.html">record $28 million</a> online -- more than Howard Dean raised in his entire 2004 campaign.  Twice this campaign cycle, Ron Paul has set <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/12/16/ron_paul_beats_own_fundraising.html?hpid=topnews">single day fundraising records</a>.   If anything, the power of online fundraising has been proved many times over during this election.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Looking over Obama's numbers, we see that an overwhelming amount of that $28 million was via small donations -- 90% under $100 each.  10,000 people gave between $5 and $10.  That's a whole new paradigm for fundraising.  Rather than chase $2,300 checks from a few hundred rich people at lavish fundraisers (okay, they still do that), campaigns can more easily focus on collecting thousands of smaller donations from regular people that add up to the same amount (or more).</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Further, 10,000 donations under $10 means the email addresses of 10,000 people who can still give more money later.  About half of Hilary Clinton's money came from "maxed out" voters compared to just about one third for Obama.  That gives Obama a much larger pool of donors to hit up for more cash and to put on notice for get out the vote campaigns.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Though I am loathe to agree with Karl Rove, he's right about how the Internet is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120173791597330347.html?mod=hpp_us_insid">affecting campaign fundraising</a>.  "The Internet dramatically shortens the gap between political success and raising money," he wrote. "Today, if you do well in a debate on Tuesday night you can begin raising large sums of money Wednesday morning. Effective fundraising can be a mouse-click away."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>That's something that nearly all of the campaigns are doing.  Within hours after Obama's win in South Carolina, his campaign had dispatched emails to supporters pitching for donations.  However, raising money doesn't win elections.  "Raising the most amount of money by no means assures you of winning the presidential primary," <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=127039&src=117">says former chairman</a> of the Federal Election Commission Michael Toner.  And for Paul, money and online popularity hasn't translated into votes.  For Obama, though, arguably his online success has had an impact at the polls.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The reason may be in get out the vote efforts of each party.  Both Paul and Obama, with their anti-war stances and Internet savvy, are attractive to young voters.  But only the Democrats are succeeding in getting young people to the voting booths.  In Iowa, exit polls showed 40% of voters under the age of 44, and Obama killed in those demographics.  On the Republican side, just 26% of voters were under 44.  That picture was repeated in other early primary states.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Incidentally, this is also potentially the reason that Mike Huckabee has faded as well -- he appeals to young people with, as one <a href="http://www.thestate.com/447/story/293548.html">South Carolina paper writes</a>, "his celebrity supporters, preacher\u2019s gift for humor and skill with an electric guitar."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The Democrats are succeeding with young people because they are targeting young people and they are using the Internet to successfully microtarget and rally their base.  The Obama campaign, for example, uses <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog/entry/21119/is_the_obama_campaign_a_model_for_online_politics">sophisticated targeting tools</a> that let them send specially tailored campaign materials to each voter.  Firm supporters get a different email than those on the fence.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Other progressive organizations are using similar tools.  One is called <a href="http://catalist.us/">Catalist</a>.  It is used by large progressive organizations like MoveOn and the AFL-CIO to microtarget their campaigns. According to Tony DeYoung of Catalyst Resources (unrelated to Catalist -- Catalyst is a design firm that was contracted by Catalist to redesign the UI of their "Q-Tool" software), Catalist utilizes "on-demand data analysis services to help Democratics microtarget in their voter outreach efforts. Microtargeting uses sophisticated computer models regularly used in commercial marketing, which helps campaigns to locate sympathetic voters and target them with individually tailored messages on issues that are predicted to be most important to them."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>This is the same technique the Republicans employed to great effect in 2004 to get out messages to conservative evangelical Christian voters -- who this election cycle don't have a clear cut favorite among the front runners.  Which may explain why their get out the vote efforts aren't working as well this time around.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>So while both Obama and Paul are running effective online campaigns, albeit in different ways, the get out the vote efforts of the Democrats, which target young people, play to Obama's strength.  While strong turnout by voters over the age of 45 have played to John McCain on the Republican side.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><b>Related:</b> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/keeping_tabs_on_super_tuesday.php">Keeping Tabs on Super Tuesday</a></p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=omtx9C"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=omtx9C" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=S1OsFTE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=S1OsFTE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=dnZyOeE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=dnZyOeE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=Gh08Moe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=Gh08Moe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=BbbnQIe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=BbbnQIe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=xkOd3te"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=xkOd3te" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=sT7nyJE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=sT7nyJE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=bG52AXE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=bG52AXE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229682770" height="1" width="1" />

I assume you believe in free trade and know of its benefits, don't vote green and agree that labour and environmental matters should be left out of trade agreements and pursed by other means. </p>  <p align="left"></p> <p align="left"><strong>John McCain</strong></p> <p align="left"></p> <p align="left">This <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/John_McCain.htm">site</a> has McCain's position on free trade and it lists (I've edited it and the other lists that follow) his positions as being among:</p> <ul> <p align="left"> <li>Considers subsidies a mistake, and opposes them. </li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Believes very time US went protectionist, America a paid heavy price</li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Supports ethanol, but by exporting, not by subsidies (this might suggest he is against 'infant industry arguments')</li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>No environmental provisions in be placed trade agreements. </li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Substitute trade treaties for protectionism. </li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Would admit China to WTO based on their concessions (and keep open trade &amp; diplomacy; but keep eyes open)</li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Free trade with any country except security risks. Retaliatory protectionism is a &quot;murder-suicide pact&quot;. </li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>Mexico: balancing act between free trade &amp; stopping drugs. </li> <p></p> <p align="left"> <li>NAFTA has had unambiguously positive impact on US (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement">NAFTA</a> -North America Free Trade Agreement. </li> <p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></ul> <p align="left"></p> <p align="left">The money quote&nbsp; &quot;I don't believe in walls.

Only risks to the security of our vital interests or egregious offenses to our most cherished political values should disqualify a nation from entering into a free trade agreement with us.&quot;</p>  <p align="left">Thus there is a clear direction that he would take if he became American President.

Hilary would just be Hilary \u2013 a lecturer once suggested&nbsp;to me in&nbsp;a tutorial&nbsp;that woman leave their feminity at the door when they enter politics and just follow the behavioural standard set by men - so I don't see her being a woman as significant reason to vote for her in terms of making change&nbsp;\u2013 but maybe that view is tainted by NZ being spoiled by having so many successful women in top jobs and just getting on with it. <font size="2"></font></p> <br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong>  Mr McCain actually <a href="http://wellington.usembassy.gov/senators.html">has been in NZ</a> and totally advocated for the advancement of a FTA with America.

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/aviarylogo.jpg" />Online media processing tool suite <a href="http://a.viary.com">Aviary</a> is opening up two of its many services to those who have requested beta access and a limited number of new requesters.  The first two tools, an image editor and a pattern generator, are impressive and will be followed by a vector editor next month and the rest of the Aviary tools later.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Photoshop contest site <a href="http://worth1000.com">Worth1000</a> is behind Aviary and built the tools in Flex and Actionscript3.  The primary value of making the image editor social is in allowing users to view multiple steps in an image's creation process.  You can fork off into a new design at any point in the design timeline, you can leave comments, etc.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Forthcoming tools from Aviary include audio and video editors, a font editor, digital content marketplace service and more.  If you'd like an invite to Aviary's services, just visit the site and the first 100 RWW readers will get in right away.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The following is a short video demonstrating the image editor made by its creators. Let's be generous and presume that the choice to demonstrate the tool in transforming a young sex object, driven to psychiatric institutionalization into an old, poor, sickly looking image of womanhood reflects only a lack of maturity on the part of the Aviary staff and is not instead a reflection on the quality of their souls.  In other words, <em>leave Britney alone,</em> dudes.  Just another day in the male dominated tech world - may the creatives of the future be more creative than this.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Either way, it's a good looking set of tools that I look forward to seeing how our readers put to use.<br />\u000A<center><br />\u000A     </center></p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=g298MT"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=g298MT" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=P7GsRZE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=P7GsRZE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=RqabHrE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=RqabHrE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=7hLuQze"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=7hLuQze" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=ZHL3gte"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=ZHL3gte" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=xYm1HEe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=xYm1HEe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=UziyD0E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=UziyD0E" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=xPrRX9E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=xPrRX9E" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229736683" height="1" width="1" />

VmiVitals Takes Aim at Tough Online Health Market

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/mivitals_logo.png" /><a href="http://www.mivitals.com/">miVitals</a> is a new Australian startup that has an ambitious goal: to enable individuals to manage their personal health data via a  web application. miVitals describes itself as &quot;a secure online storage system for health and lifestyle records&quot;. The company says that &quot;most people have about 5 professionals involved in their health management: GP, dentist, optician, specialist, pharmacist.&quot; So miVitals aims to be a central repository of a person's health data - and in future to enable them to share relevant pieces with health professionals and family.  </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Probably the main point is that miVitals wants to give consumers <strong>control over their own health data</strong>. If that theme sounds familiar, it's because <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/openid_20_finally_launched.php">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/most_promising_web_2008_open_source.php">similar initiatives</a> aim to do the same thing for your social networking and other identity data on the Web. Control of one's data is a key driver for many new web apps today.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/rww_files_health2.jpg" align="right" /><em><strong>Note:</strong> this post is the start of a special investigation series into Web-enabled healthcare, sometimes referred to as 'health 2.0'. Over the next few weeks ReadWriteWeb will be looking at recent examples of healthcare web apps and the general trend of utilizing the Internet in the healthcare industry. If you have a healthcare app that you'd like us to take a look at, please email <a href="mailto:tips@readwriteweb.com">tips@readwriteweb.com</a> and include the word 'health' in the subject line.</em></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>miVitals Target Audience</h2>\u000A<p>miVitals is targeting a global audience, including Australia, USA, Canada and the UK. The core health module is available for free, but the company plans to introduce premium services in the future. </p>\u000A<p>As mentioned above, it's a consumer app - and at this stage isn't integrated into healthcare systems. More on that below, but we should note that miVitals isn't claiming to <em>replace</em> medical records. Instead it provides users with &quot;a place for complete history of relevant health information, in much the same way people currently manage their own financial information.&quot; An example given is of a healthy thirty year old professional whose occupation requires extensive international travel. This person, named Brian, &quot;records his regular exercise and keeps track of his immunisations, doctor\u2019s visits and blood pressure using miVitals.&quot;</p>\u000A<h2>Features</h2>\u000A<p>Currently miVitals offers features such as the ability to store your medical records, manage accounts for your family, record appointments, create  an emergency report. Coming soon are further reports, graphing functionality, mobile phone funcntionality, the all-important ability to share information with  health care professionals, and more. Right now, miVitals seems light in features.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/mivitals2b.jpg" /><br />\u000A<em>miVitals UI</em></p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/mivitals1b.jpg" /><br />\u000A<em>Example emergency report</em></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Issues: Privacy &amp; Integration with Health Systems</h2>\u000A<p>miVitals sounds great in theory, and the current app is functional enough. But of course when it comes to health data there are a couple of key issues to overcome:</p>\u000A<p>1) Ensuring that the data is ultra secure and that all privacy bases are covered; and</p>\u000A<p>2) Getting healthcare professionals to use the system.</p>\u000A<p>miVitals has a <a href="http://www.mivitals.com/index.cfm?page=Privacy">Privacy Policy</a> that goes some way to covering the first issue. You still need to convince consumers that their data is truly safe on the Web - which with very personal data like health, is a tough ask. Even I'm not fully comfortable storing my health data online yet.</p>\u000A<p>But the second issue is probably the biggest - and will require integration with existing healthcare IT systems. I asked miVitals if integration with other health systems is on the cards? A miVitals representative told me that yes, it is &quot;absolutely on the development path for the future, along with professionals access to reports that users generate.&quot;</p>\u000A<p>However, integration is a huge obstacle and one that many startups have tried to solve before, including in the original 'dot com' era. One that springs to mind is Jim Clark's famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healtheon">Healtheon</a> startup - as outlined in Michael Lewis' must-read dot com book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Thing-Silicon-Valley-Story/dp/0393048136">The New New Thing</a>, Clark (the co-founder of Netscape and one of Silicon Valley's enduring folk heroes) set out to revolutionize the healthcare industry in the US via an Internet startup named Healtheon. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healtheon">the Wikipedia notes</a>, Healtheon &quot;developed software that essentially placed their company between physicians, patients, and health care institutions, eliminating unnecessary paperwork and facilitating networking and communication amongst the three.&quot; Although initially unsuccessful, in late 1999 Healtheon merged with the Microsoft-backed <a href="http://www.webmd.com/">WebMD</a> - and  today the combined entity is considered the leading health portal. </p>\u000A<h2>Crowded Market</h2>\u000A<p>One of miVitals' problems is that WebMD already does what miVitals sets out to do. As <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/46265-webmd-has-tremendous-growth-ahead">Sramana Mitra pointed out</a> in September, &quot;apart from offering articles and diagnostic tools, [WebMD] allows users to store their health records for easy access as they visit different doctors.&quot; See also Sramana's analysis of <a href="http://sramanamitra.com/2007/08/21/web-30-online-health-part-2/">other online health providers</a>. </p>\u000A<p>Plus don't forget that <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-08-14-n43.html">Google is eyeing up</a> the lucrative online health market too! Google is very well placed to offer a web app that organizes users health data, seeing as organizing the world's information is its core mission.</p>\u000A<h2>Conclusion</h2>\u000A<p>miVitals is an ambitious app, but the <strong>competitive landscape is very tough</strong> - and will only get tougher once Google enters the fray. </p>\u000A<p>Also as of now, miVitals essentially requires individuals to do two key things. Firstly, you must obtain your health data from healthcare providers. This is actually no easy task - I have  trouble getting my doctor's office to send prescriptions to my local chemist, let alone getting the data for my own use! Even if you get the data, you then need to enter it into miVitals. Or if you're lucky, you'll get an electronic version - but once again red tape from the health system will likely prevent that. </p>\u000A<p>In other words, the <strong>lack of integration</strong> with current health systems puts up a big obstacle. This is not a new issue; and it won't be fully solved for years to come. Anyone who has dealt with healthcare systems before (which is most of us) knows how tricky and frustrating it is.</p>\u000A<p>One final issue with miVitals: as a user, you'll need to be <strong>motivated by your circumstances</strong> to enter data into miVitals. While the 30 year old  who travels frequently (noted above) has good reason to have a central repository of his health data, this won't be the case for most people. Take me for example: I travel every few months and I have diabetes. But rather than enter my health data into a new system, I'm more inclined to just put some key paper records into my suitcase every time I travel. Unfortunately, any time that you need to duplicate data entry or enter data into a system when there isn't a compelling reason, it puts an extra barrier on web apps.</p>\u000A<p>miVitals does get a lot of points from me for its initiative and goals. Plus the web app itself is nice and the UI nifty. Overall,  in theory the app is great. But there are a lot of practical issues to overcome, plus some very big players already in the market - or about to enter it.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=qmxkAz"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=qmxkAz" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=prnllLE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=prnllLE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=HbzHJ1E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=HbzHJ1E" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=v2Rn9Ue"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=v2Rn9Ue" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=yb9Iq3e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=yb9Iq3e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=6fMebWe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=6fMebWe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=BpixhZE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=BpixhZE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=0LSyBVE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=0LSyBVE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229325538" height="1" width="1" />

Well worth a read, even if you don't agree.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://jimmyjangles.blogspot.com/2008/02/why-john-mcain-becoming-next-america.html">Jimmy Jangles compares</a> the positions of McCain, Clinton and Obama on free trade.  My summary is McCain is a passionate supporter, Clinton is mildly supportive and fence sitting while Obama is against.  It is a useful reminder that one can like Obama's rhetoric but not like his policy positions. I love the quote from McCain:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>"I don't believe in walls. I believe in freedom. If I were President, I would negotiate a free trade agreement with almost any country willing to negotiate fairly with us. Only risks to the security of our vital interests or egregious offenses to our most cherished political values should disqualify a nation from entering into a free trade agreement with us."</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Poneke <a href="http://poneke.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/civic/">chats to Peter Ellis</a>. I did laugh at Ellis' sense of humour:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Every time I\u2019ve met Ellis, he\u2019s exhibited the sharp wit that has at times got him into trouble. This time was no exception. \u201CWhen I started at the Civic in 1987, some parents were so PC that we had to call the girls little women, not little girls,\u201D he said while reminiscing about his former workplace, which was regarded as the trendiest in Christchurch. Wealleans, whose wife worked at the Civic for years, mentioned putting a \u201Cdon\u2019t vote Labour\u201D icon on the <a href="http://www.peterellis.org.nz/">Peter Ellis website</a> to protest at the Government\u2019s lack of action on the case, such an icon likely breaching the Electoral Finance Act. \u201CThat\u2019d be great, Winston,\u201D Ellis said immediately. \u201CYou might find yourself sitting in jail with me having to visit you for a change.\u201D</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>And on my suggestion of a blog campaign for a Royal Commission:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>\u201CI can\u2019t even drive a car. Some people just aren\u2019t mechanically minded. I\u2019ve managed to wreck five lawnmowers and a washing machine. Imagine what I would do with a computer. Isn\u2019t a blog like a bog with an \u2018l\u2019 in it? From what I\u2019ve heard, some of these young girls today have blogs they use to flash their bits and pieces on. But yes, I don\u2019t see why not. I have no objection to people supporting a royal commission with their blogs.\u201D</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Aaron Bhatnagar blogs on the <a href="http://aucklandblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/waiheke-wanting-to-secede-from-auckland.html">Waiheke Island seccession movement</a>.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.publicaddress.net/default,4793.sm#post4793">Graeme Edgeler</a> has a well timed post on the delegate count and how delegates are won in the US primaries.</p>

VThe ACT Party placed ths ad in the Sunday Star/Times supporting a referendum to overturn the anti-smacking legislation.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6dURC_IoAI/AAAAAAAABVc/6x0bs2ezLww/s1600-h/actpetition.jpg"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6dURC_IoAI/AAAAAAAABVc/6x0bs2ezLww/s400/actpetition.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5163188149639749634" /></a><br />David Farrar at <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/02/act_supporting_anti-smacking_law_referendum.html">KiwiBlog</a> posted about it yesterday.<br /><br />Here are some positive comments from the resulting thread.<br /><br /><em>James W Says: <br /><br />Well I like it.<br /><br />At least there\u2019s a party standing up for keeping government out of our lives. I still can\u2019t get over the fact that National voted for it.<br /><br />Ross Nixon Says: <br /><br />ACT is NOT supporting a christian conservative cause.<br />ACT is supporting democracy!<br /><br />PaulL Says: <br /><br />The liberal party. That would be the party that doesn\u2019t think the govt should tell us how to spend our money, or how to behave on matters of moral conscience. This fits exactly - there is research suggesting that an occasional smack is a reasonable part of good parenting, there is research suggesting it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t the government\u2019s place to legislate on this, it is a choice for parents. It is exactly a liberal issue.<br /><br />Matthew Says: <br /><br />you are enttiled to your opinion. Now let\u2019s look at the facts. This legislation was opposed by anywhere between 70% and 96% of the electorate as indicated by polls at the time. In anyone\u2019s language that constitutes a majority, and one that the politicians should take note of. I have collected many signatures for the CIR that we are aiming for and my personal experience (along with other petition collectors) is that 90% of the people we approach are publically willing to sign (meaning signature, name and residential address). Many signatories are not Christian, some do not smack their children, and some support the Greens. In other words, this is an issue that cuts across the political divide, and makes your claim of what is a \u201Cconservative Christain cause\u201D unapplicable.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be quite interested in your defintions of \u201Csmall subset\u201D, \u201Cever reducing\u201D and \u201Cmajority of society\u201D once we have the referendum. <br /><br />Finally, putting the ad in the SST, which as you say has a centre-left leaning editorial position is possible proof that this is an issue that crosses the political divide (or maybe they are just cheaper because they have lower advertising rates, but then that wouldn\u2019t be relevant for ACT now, would it). Or do you think Rodney is just stupid (in which case did you ask him why he did?)?<br /><br />PP,<br /><br />you misunderstand what liberal means on this issue. Freedom of choice for parents is a liberal concept\u2026i.e. favoring or permitting freedom of action, esp. with respect to matters of personal belief or expression. Note the \u201Cfreedom of action\u201D <br /><br />James W Says: <br /><br />February 4th, 2008 at 9:27 pm <br />Yea PP, i\u2019m not sure you understand the term \u201Cliberal\u201D in the european sense of the word (classical liberalism). PaulL has it right. It\u2019s about less government. It\u2019s about letting people make their own choices based on their own morals and not having an overgrown state do it for us.<br /><br />Simeon Says: <br /><br />Yup ACT is supporting democracy. Something which is very hard to come by in NZ.<br /><br />radvad Says: <br /><br />radar<br />\u201CACT is the party for smacking your kids. Nice move\u201D<br /><br />Typical lefty blinkered comment. ACT does not support smacking, ACT supports a parents right to choose how to raise their children without nanny state interfering. As such they are the only party that comes close to being liberal.<br /><br /><br />francis Says: <br /><br />I can only hope the rest of the Bradford Bunch have the same blinkered view of this issue as it goes forward and that they stick to their wee guns on principle - it will make things so much easier. This is a very good political move for ACT - and the issue resonates enormously with so many parents that he could ride the position to the 5pc and beyond. ACT will be the only party of any credibility with this take - and all those people who care more about this one thing than anything else (and there are many) will be really tempted to go ACT.<br /><br />barry Says: <br /><br />Act have my party vote (at the moment) - and they come out with some decent policies on education and welfare control - then they will keep it.<br /><br />However they will have to work hard as national are certainly on the rise.<br /><br />Lesson from last parliament - the bloody greens did more to hurt this country than lanour did to help it. We certainly have a tail wag the dog problem at the moment.<br /><br />And the anti smaking bill is going to cost labour dearly.<br /><br /><br />ropata Says: <br /><br />Parents are liable if little Johnny goes on a criminal rampage and smashes up 10 cars.<br />Parents are liable for hospital bills if little Johnny hurts himself and goes to hospital.<br />Parents are liable if they have the temerity to restrain little Johnny with a little force.<br /><br />The State cannot abide any person daring to use force to chastise their child, or to defend themselves from harm, or to protect their property. We are supposed to roll over like defenseless, supine slugs and wait for the State and the Police to ride in and solve all our problems. It\u2019s not a healthy way to develop a robust nation.<br /><br />Bogusnews Says: <br /><br />I believe the antismacking issue will be on the agenda for National at their retreat.<br /><br />Frankly, as a parent, it is quite frightening that NZ\u2019ers now constantly have to look over their shoulder in case one of their fellow countrymen dobb them in. This isn\u2019t the NZ I grew up in. No wonder so many are leaving.</em><br /><br />ACT stands on principle on this issue. Rodney and Heather voted against <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2006/03/sue-bradford-nice-lady-shame-about.html">Sue Bradford's </a>anti-family bill when it came before Parliament and have been consistent in their opposition since.<br /><br />People, who believe the state should stay out of families, should support this petition and party vote ACT in this year's election.

V<div align="justify"><a href="http://pc.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-law-for-all-day.html">PC has written an excellent post</a> on Waitangi Day and what it could be, and being in the \u201Cmother country\u201D of course, I wont have that day off.   However, I can reflect on what it is like to be away from all of the wailing and gnashing of teeth that is around when the usual tribe of tired old collectivists seek to treat people on the basis of \u201Cethnicity\u201D not behaviour.<br />~<br />As PC has said:<br />~<br />What the Treaty did do, for which we can all be thankful, was to bring British law to NZ at a time when British law was actually intended to protect the rights of British citizens, and it promised to extend that protection to all who lived here. For many and often differing reasons, that was what the chieftains signed up to.  To become British citizens, with all the rights and privileges thereof.<br />~<br />Indeed!<br />~<br />And yes, I do know that for some, these rights and privileges were in practice more limited, due to sexism for one, and racism.  I know the 19th century was hardly a period of colourblind government anywhere, but in the realm of colonialism the Treaty was a significant step.    No such rights and privileges for Australian aborigines.<br />~<br />Unfortunately, Waitangi Day perennially becomes the rallying point for those who prefer tribalism and separatism, those who believe in intergenerational blame and guilt, and moreso the idea that you can blame your current life on what happened to your ancestors.  <br />~<br />It is identity politics, the notion that what matters most is not what you do, but what group you \u201Cidentify\u201D with.   Interwoven with this is the belief that people treat you according to that identity, and that statistics can \u201Cprove\u201D unfair treatment if members of an \u201Cidentity\u201D perform \u201Cbelow average\u201D.   You know what I mean, the idea that more Maori are in prison not because they committed crimes, but because \u201Cthe system\u201D was against them.   Those of other identities don\u2019t have this disadvantage because the system was \u201Cdesigned by and for them\u201D.  It denies objective analysis, it denies those who reject identity politics as either part of the problem, or traitors. <br />~<br />The corollary of that is the notion that ones life today is directly attributable to what someone else\u2019s ancestors did generations ago.   To carry the notion that being unhealthy, being poorly educated and committing crimes is because you carry the pain of your forefathers is to be psychologically unhinged.   No one can doubt that one\u2019s inheritance matters, but what is done with it matters too.   In fact far more important that material inheritance is the psychological one.   <br />~<br />Did you have parents who loved you, taught the value of hard work, education, respect and support you as your grew and learnt?   That is far more likely to influence whether you commit crime, get a job, look after yourself and do the same to your children.   Then beyond that is what you do with THAT personal inheritance.   Sadly far too many Maori are being told that they don\u2019t have choices, that it isn\u2019t their parents fault they bashed them up or neglected them, but \u201Csociety\u201D.<br />~<br />Waitangi Day could be a day to celebrate the founding of a nation-state, the opportunities it brings to those who live there, the relative freedom, lack of corruption and rule of law that exists. </div><div align="justify">~   </div><div align="justify">When you see those advancing \u201Ctino rangitiratanga\u201D ask yourself what they mean by that?  Do they mean the individual freedom and private property rights that British law SHOULD have granted them (and all citizens)?  Or do they mean they want more government, government based on race, interventionist government, with more taxes and more control over education, broadcasting, property rights and the economy?   Is it a coincidence that almost all those advocating \u201Ctino rangitiratanga\u201D get inspiration from authoritarian socialists?</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">So don't think of Waitangi Day by race - race is not an objective way to judge a person and it has no place in any considerations of state.   Waitangi Day should be a day to celebrate the common nationhood of New Zealand.   </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">Then take the concept of one law for all - colourblind - and ask politicians this year, election year, whether they believe in that and what they'll do about it.   Chances are the two main party leaders wont deliver.</div>

V<div class="snap_preview"><br /><p>The Treaty of Waitangi is not some abstract notion of little importance to anyone. It is New Zealand\u2019s founding constitutional document, and it affects our lives in various real ways, legally and by the manner in which we conduct our public affairs. Waitangi Day is our country\u2019s national day and it is a day worth celebrating, not something to be slightly ashamed of.</p>\u000A<p>Wellingtonians have the opportunity to mark today by checking out the actual Treaty document. Yes, the very one signed on this day in 1840 by Captain William Hobson, RN and the assembled chiefs of the northern tribes at Waitangi. Not many people seem to know that the Treaty is on permanent display in the Constitution Room at <a href="http://www.archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/permanentexhibitions/treaty.php">Archives NZ</a> in Mulgrave St, Wellington, opposite Aitken St. Archives is open today from 10am to 4pm specially for people to look at the Treaty. Go there.</p>\u000A<p>The Treaty was a product of both missionary and official British desire to ensure Maori were treated substantially better than indigenous Australians were when formal British occupation of their country began 52 years before Waitangi. Though settler honouring of the Treaty only lasted until their demands for land exceeded iwi willingness to sell, much that happened in New Zealand was still far and away better than what happened in Australia, as I wrote in <a href="http://poneke.wordpress.com/2007/12/26/sorry/">my December article</a> on new Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s intention finally to say \u201Csorry\u201D to the Aborigines for the shameful way they were treated for the best part of 200 years.</p>\u000A<p>Despite the land grabs that took place here and the suppression of much of Maori culture until about 1970, many good things happened too, especially in comparison with Australia and many other colonised countries, and more has been done to make amends in the past three decades than probably anywhere else.</p>\u000A<p>In 1869, a full 100 years before Australian Aborigines were allowed to vote, the colonial New Zealand Parliament extended the franchise to all Maori men, at a time many settler men remained excluded. Maori had to vote in the four special seats created for them, but the fact they were allowed to vote was an important and enlightened development for the time, 24 years before our pioneering enfranchisement of women. New Zealand never had laws overtly discriminating against Maori or preventing them from taking part in civil and political life. Intermarriage has been common and accepted here since Europeans started arriving, to the extent that most people of Maori ancestry now also have European ancestry. There has always been a general goodwill between the races here, even during times of strain and controversy. Since 1970 there has been a remarkable renaissance of Maori culture, language and participation in the political process. The creation of the Waitangi Tribunal in 1975 led to the continuing, honorable, bipartisan settling of land and other grievances dating back to colonial times, a process Australia has barely begun. Not everyone has been happy with the settlement process. Many Pakeha were at the beginning suspicious and opposed, though that has now much waned. Many Maori still feel it is taking too long. But it is nonetheless taking place.</p>\u000A<p>These are things to reflect on, to celebrate and be proud of today, 168 years after the signing of the Treaty. As John Clarke used to sing in his Fred Dagg days, sometimes we don\u2019t know how lucky we are.</p>\u000A<p><b>Other Waitangi blogging:</b> Stef the Ex-expat has <a href="http://exexpat1.blogspot.com/2008/02/pakeha-language-pricks.html">a thoughtful Waitangi Day essay</a> on Pakeha learning te reo. <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/02/clark_blunders_again.html">David Farrar</a> says Helen Clark blundered by staying away from Te Tii Marae, while John Key looked prime ministerial. David makes the hilarious point that only in New Zealand could one see the spectacle of someone like John Key "shaking hands with Tame Iti, who was arrested by the police for allegedly being the leader of a group which aimed, amongst other things, to assassinate John Key." <a href="http://pc.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-law-for-all-day.html">Not PC</a> has an interesting, black-letter-law, Eurocentrist view of the Treaty, which, probably deliberately, misses the point that times change.</p>\u000A<img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/categories/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/tags/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/poneke.wordpress.com/86/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/poneke.wordpress.com/86/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/poneke.wordpress.com/86/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/poneke.wordpress.com/86/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/poneke.wordpress.com/86/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/poneke.wordpress.com/86/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=poneke.wordpress.com&blog=2287634&post=86&subd=poneke&ref=&feed=1" /></div>

VAlthough outcomes are rated as 'good', waiting times for health treatment in Sweden are now the longest in Europe. <br /><br /><span>Long waits are a hallmark of government health care anywhere it's employed.  When the perception exists that treatment is free (it is not; Swedes pay more than half their gross income in taxes to support the welfare state), system overuse is inevitable.  People can think of no reason to self-ration care.  They show up in emergency rooms and doctor's offices with conditions for which they wouldn't seek treatment if they paid directly at the time of service, says IBD.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=15548">More.</a>

V<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2163/2244598540_aafde6831e_o.gif" />Although we're hopeful that Hollywood's writers strike is nearly at its end, the \u000Aexperience has led us to discover other entertainment venues. One area where \u000Athere seems to be a lot of development lately is in Internet TV. The latest is a \u000A100% indie Internet TV channel with 24/7 programming, created by Jeff Pulver, \u000AVOIP pioneer and the founder of <a href="http://www.pulver.com/">pulver.com</a>. Each week, <a href="http://www.pulver.tv/">pulverTV</a> creates 12-14 hours of their own \u000Aoriginal programming and the rest is culled from over 40 different producers of \u000Aindependently created Internet TV shows from the web. The TV shows span several \u000Adifferent genres including comedy, drama, sci-fi, anime, health, cooking, \u000Alifestyles, fitness, and business/finance.  \u000A\u000A<p>Until the launch of the 24/7 programming, pulverTV was the home of&nbsp; "<a href="http://www.blogtv.com/Shows/96">The Jeff Pulver Show</a>," a program \u000Awhich Jeff has been hosting since April 2007. This show will continue to be one \u000Aof the featured programs on pulverTV, first airing live (you can catch the next \u000Aone on Wednesday, Feb 6th at 2 PM EST), then being re-broadcast later in the \u000Aprogramming schedule. \u000A</p><p>Along with producers Ariel Schwartz and Andy Lipson and sponsor BlogTV, \u000Athe pulverTV channel was formed. One of their main goals with the service is to provide a \u000Aplatform for the indie creators of Internet TV to get their shows discovered. By \u000Aproviding the technology, production, and distribution information to any of \u000Athose who request it, the platform can be a launch point for currently \u000Aundiscovered talent. Alongside that goal is, pulverTV wants to provide quality \u000A24/7 programming in order to close the gap between TV and "Internet TV." \u000A</p><p>Internet TV producers and creators with an existing program they want to \u000Apublicize or with one they want to create can <a href="mailto:jeffp@pulver.com">contact Jeff</a> via email for more information \u000Aon how to get started.</p><p>Always on Internet TV (that isn't lifecasting) - love the idea!

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/vidooplogo.jpg" />Tulsa, Oklahoma based authentication service <a href="http://vidoop.com">Vidoop</a> announced today that it has hired <a href="http://kveton.com/blog/">Scott Kveton</a>, Chair of the <a href="http://openid.net/wiki/index.php/OpenID_Foundation">OpenID Foundation</a>, to be the company's VP of Open Platforms and the Director of the company's new West Coast office in Portland, Oregon.  With the move Kveton ends a short run at the heavily funded and very interesting <a href="http://mystrands.com">MyStrands</a> recommendation service, a development that raises some questions about that otherwise strong looking operation.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The addition of Kveton to its staff should push Vidoop into the public consciousness in a big way, concerning OpenID and open platforms.<br />\u000A</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/Picture%2023.png" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" />Kveton is a force to reckon with and an outspoken advocate for Open Platforms. He was a co-founder of the <a href="http://osuosl.org/">Open Source Lab at OSU</a>, a research facility that's provided hosting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Lab">a long list of Open Source projects</a> ranging from Mozilla to the Linux Kernel.  He was also the CEO of <a href="http://janrain.com">JanRain</a>, a leading OpenID vendor, and now chairs the OpenID Foundation.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>For readers interested in learning more about OpenID and related data portability matters, Kveton did <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3510.html">an excellent interview on Phil Windley's Technometria last month</a> that will satisfy both the uninitiated and the already involved. </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>The Vidoop Product</h2>\u000AVidoop is a small shop made up largely of former US Navy cryptographers.  They are entirely revenue funded and have a really interesting product.  Though there are any number of advanced security features, here's the basic story.  \u000A\u000A<p>Vidoop asks users to select a handful of topical categories which are then used to populate images in a square of largely random tiled images.  See the example below.  If when creating your account with Vidoop you said you like pictures of dogs, birds and board games - then you and only you would know to pick out the letters embedded in the handful of images in a grid presented at login that happen to contain dogs, birds and board games.    <strong>Some of those images will include advertisements!</strong>  In other words, Vidoop has found a way to monetize OpenID authentication - and they are doing it live with a handful of major corporate customers already.  See the sample below.  It's much easier used than explained, by me at least.  </p>\u000A\u000A<p>It's strangely fascinating and I'm not sure how happy I am about the advertisements sneaking their way into my consciousness as I look closely for puppy pictures.  That said, we here at RWW have puppy pictures hidden inside our ads on site too (look!) so who am I to criticize?</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Readers interested in comparing various OpenID providers should see the <a href="http://spreadopenid.org/provider-comparison/">vendor comparison chart at SpreadOpenID.org</a>.</p>\u000A\u000A<center><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/vidoopscreen.jpg" /></center>\u000A\u000A<p><br />\u000A</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=HnZ42w"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=HnZ42w" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=XFiu06E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=XFiu06E" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=m4LAumE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=m4LAumE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=C0RWJfe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=C0RWJfe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=aeS5Dke"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=aeS5Dke" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=WJEncse"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=WJEncse" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=CYMo2UE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=CYMo2UE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=7P0n8wE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=7P0n8wE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229808372" height="1" width="1" />

V<div>It's not only New Zealand women who are looking for "real men",  it seems New Zealand <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490687">schools</a> are as well.<br /><br />Everyone knows that teaching these days is a profession reserved for <span>women, Unionists, sissys and homos</span>.  And I mean that in a respectful way.  After all most of them did spend $30,000 of the taxpayers money on scholarships and interest free student loans completing the lofty academic heights of an Arts degree to then find themselves in front of a class of teenagers where plenty of students are actually smarter than they are.<br /><br /><img alt="The image \u201Chttp://media.apn.co.nz/webcontent/image/jpg/lind1.jpg\u201D cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://media.apn.co.nz/webcontent/image/jpg/lind1.jpg" /> Real man.

Trevor Mallard with reptile.</span><br /><br />The study's author Penni Cushman reveals the real issue with New Zealand education at present:<br /><br /><span>"Not all boys or girls are going to relate to a man who's a rugby player, because not all boys play rugby."</span><br /><br />Well they bloody well should.  Every boy should play rugby.<br /><br />I mean you can't be a real man unless you have played Saturday morning rugby and had mud stomped in your hair to react with the liniment and inch long abrasions from the sprigs of another players size 5 boot.<br /><br /><span>One respondent in the study - being published in international journal </span><i>Gender and Education</i><span> - referred to the "limp" handshakes of two male teachers who appeared ineffectual and wussy when interviewing for jobs. In that case, strong females were hired instead.</span><br /><br />Well quite right as well.  A limp handshake is a sign of weakness in even a real profession's list.  Put in front of 30 fatherless brats whose mothers were left abandoned each with 3 children and a dog while their father ran off with Debbie from the fish and chip shop to Surfers to escape child support, and the poor limpo would have no shot.<br /><br />The issue of the scarcity of the white hetero male has not changed since I went to school in the 80's.  A young white male heterosexual teacher was a rare thing.  Kind of like a white male Pharmacist or a white male nurse.  The white male heterosexual teacher was soon thrust into a male rolemodel position he couldn't possibly hold up to and was soon either made Principal (<span>as in the case of my fabulous former maths teacher Roger Menzies (above)</span>) or left for greener pastures or to a small town with the music teacher.  That was usually the issue with the white male heterosexual teacher actually - female teachers on staff would thrust themselves all over him and he had trouble keeping his trousers on.<br /><br />That a teacher is white, brown, gay, old, young, male or female shouldn't matter if they are a good teacher.  Hell, it's not like they are rocket scientists.  They stand up in front of a class, attempt to keep some sort of order and recite the curriculum to students who should be fearful to fail exams.  Yes, teachers are AVERAGE members of society.  We should not expect so much of them.<br /><br />They are responsible for failing academic standards, yes.<br /><br />But teachers are absolutely no replacement for good parenting and absent loser fathers.<br /><br />They simply aren't paid enough to be blamed for those sort of ills of society caused by the very parents who demand far too much from them in relation to their child who in many cases is an uncontrollable shit-box at home, why should they be any more controllable at school?<br /></div>

VWhat a mixed up and conflicted society we live in. It seems to boil down to not so much a breakdown between the genders but the different amount of trust and respect individuals feel towards the opposite sex. <br /><br />Twenty eight percent of all families with dependent children are being led by just one parent, predominantly female. This has come about through a combination of changed attitudes and changed government provision. As we cannot possibly know the circumstances of all these families I am inclined to accept that collectively there is culpability on both parts. But the overriding ethos of socialists (and male socialists are just as much a part of this attitude) is that men are nearly always at fault when it comes to domestic difficulties. And so the past forty years has seen an increasingly feminist-influenced state compensating for his shortcomings. <br /><br />Unfortunately there is a tendency for some people to turn into what you repeatedly tell them they are - deadbeat dads. And so, even more recently, it hasn't been enough to just replace fathers - they must also be financially and emotionally punished for their inadequacies.<br /><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490687"><br />NOW</a> we have schools crying out for male teachers to compensate for the father famine. Yet the expectations these guys have to meet (and suspicion they must endure)  is keeping them well away. Who can blame them?<br /><br />What worries me is those women who don't embrace feminist fascism in their everyday lives, don't do a very good job of opposing it. I understand why. "If you are not with us, you are against us," is the intimidating reception one encounters if you dare to criticise their cherished beliefs and institutions.<br /><br />Some men are no angels. But 90 percent of those I have had anything to do with are not womanising pricks, or control freaks, or 'out-of-tune with their feelings' or bad fathers. That may be my good fortune. But I hope that it is more about expectation. We find what we look for. And if women have a singularly low opinion of men, men will reflect it. Heaven knows how the sons of men-maligners mature into anything but men worthy of malign. Behind every bad man is a mother.<br /><br />Much of the feminist distaste for men, especially amongst the lower socio-economic ranks, has now developed into mutual loathing - except when temporary emotional and physical needs demand a ceasefire. Then babies result. And it becomes the preschool and school and secondary schools job to present the child with a positive male role model. But how is he viewed by the mothers? And what has she already inculcated in her female or male child? Is it ever going to be enough to expose a child to one good male role model she has to share and can only keep for a year?  And if she is very young and inclined to physically express her fondness for her daddy-substitute, he has to keep her at a cool and uncompromising arms length. Is that really enough to compensate for a father?<br /><br />I have a flashback to sitting on the back of my father's easy chair on Sunday afternoons while he watched the rugby, me endlessly combing his ever-thinning hair. He never complained. When I was sick he was very patient and would rub my tummy if I was hanging over the toilet vomiting. When I squashed my pet mouse accidentally, breaking its leg, my father made a splint and brought him back to health. (My ever-practical mother wanted to drown it).<br /><br />It is just too sad that so many kids will never experience a good and loving father. And it is even sadder that the state, which is partly to blame for this tragedy, is now desperate to correct it through the education system. As I said last week about Key and Clark's youth policies, it is too little and too late for many of these children.

V<p>Why do we have a shortage of male primary school teachers?  One of the reasons is low pay and status (something which forms a nasty feedback loop around feminised and ghettoised professions).  Another is concerns about being accused of sexual abuse.  But a third is the fact that many of our primary school principals are just <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490687">plain old bigots</a>:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>Many primary school principals believe male primary teachers should be heterosexual, rugby-playing "real men" if they want to be good role models, new research has found.\u000A\u000A<p>One respondent in the study - being published in international journal Gender and Education - referred to the "limp" handshakes of two male teachers who appeared ineffectual and wussy when interviewing for jobs. In that case, strong females were hired instead.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000ASo, perfectly qualified teachers are not being hired because they do not meet some archaic standard of manliness.  What century are these people living in?\u000A\u000A<p>It makes even less sense when you consider the increasing diversity of New Zealand.  The old cult of rugby, racing and beer no longer holds sway, and as study author Penni Cushman points out, not everyone will relate to a rugby-playing teacher because not everyone plays rugby.  But again, it seems our primary school principals are firmly stuck in the past, and unable to cope with or reflect the modern New Zealand.

One respondent in the study - being published in international journal Gender and Education - referred to the "limp" handshakes of two male teachers who appeared ineffectual and wussy when interviewing for jobs. In that case, strong females were hired instead. The findings come amid repeated calls to raise the proportion of male primary school teachers, which fell from 42 per cent in 1956 to just 18 per cent in 2005. Study author Penni Cushman, a University of Canterbury principal lecturer in health education, said the research showed the extent of homophobia and sexism putting men off careers as primary school teachers.</i><br /><br />Isn\u2019t that weird? We all feel that there should be more male teachers in NZ schools, indeed we see time and time and time again that a lack of positive male role models helps contribute to the aggressively violent behaviour of young men, but I had always simply assumed it was because fewer men were applying to be teachers, partly because of a lack of status for the position now and partly because of society\u2019s suspicion towards men around children \u2013 but I NEVER thought for one second it was homophobic principals who are channalling some bullshit 1950s gender stereotype, but when I think about it, it was always the Principal at any school I was at who was always the uptight conservative prick whom everyone resented, if this type of bigotry is as this report suggests widespread,  no wonder schools aren\u2019t such healthy environments for anyone who doesn\u2019t play rugby.

V<p>Former league player and acquitted rapist Tea Ropati has <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490682">backed off</a> from his threat to <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490482">privately prosecute his victim</a>.  Good.  But the fact it was even made speaks volumes about his character, his sense of entitlement, and his contempt for those he preys on.

Ropati, 43, was acquitted of six sex charges last week after a seven-day trial. During the trial the complainant, who has permanent name suppression, admitted snorting a line of cocaine hours before she met Ropati at a Ponsonby bar in June 2006. Lawyer John Ropati, who was on his brother's legal team, had indicated a private prosecution was being considered because she had gone unpunished for using a class A drug. But a family statement yesterday said that would not be happening. "The Ropati family will not be taking a private prosecution re the cocaine incident at The Whiskey Bar. No such comments were made by or endorsed by Tea Ropati. Any comments made to that effect by other members of the family were in the heat of the moment and as a result of the enormous stress that the family has been under."</i><br /><br />And the rest of that statement should read, \u201CWe all consider ourselves pretty damned lucky to get off this charge when you consider the physical damage and the fact the woman was almost unconscious from booze, and counting our blessings we realize the public disgust that would be generated by trying to prosecute the woman with her own testimony in a rape case regarding coke use\u201D. The reason why the Police don\u2019t prosecute that type of evidence generated in a sex case like this is because 1) regardless of what she took prior to the alleged rape that doesn\u2019t legitimize her being raped and 2) if the Police were to spitefully use evidence like that to then prosecute women who have lost a rape prosecution, even less women (currently 9%) would come forward to press charges, in fact we would end up making the system even more difficult and degrading than it currently is.

V<div align="justify">I am trying hard to resist the only sensation I get from the US primaries, the only thing I can get passionate about, deceptive though it may be, which is to cheer anything that stops Hillary Clinton become President.</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">You see, it is visceral, it goes back to the days after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1992">Bill Clinton was elected with a minority of the popular vote</a> (forgot that, didn't you?), when Hillary decided she had been "elected" too and Bill appointed her to nationalise US health care.   It goes to her views against free market capitalism, and so much of her election platform which is about tinkering, doing more with the federal government, giving away other people's money here and there, and control.  Beyond that is her sense of entitlement to rule - she WANTS power, power over people, and she believes it is her right, her goal to be the first woman President, as if her sex gives her more entitlement.   Her willingness to play dirty against Barack Obama speaks volumes, and has backfired somewhat.   </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">While Hillary Clinton is, for anyone who believes in individual freedom, and private property rights, an anathema.  Her current opponent, Barack Obama is no better.   He is a nicer, friendlier and more seductive face of exactly the same politics.    There is no substantive difference between Obama and Clinton, indeed <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-1-forget-islam-look-at.html">Obama's endorsement by those on the left </a>such as the Kennedys (another clan of "born to be rulers"), Democratic Socialists of America and the Communist Party of the USA (hat tip: <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/">New Zeal</a>) makes him potentially more dangerous.</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">In addition to that, Obama's charisma is a contrast with Clinton's so-called divisiveness.   Obama doesn't excite conservative USA as much as Clinton does - as <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article3294433.ece">Andrew Sullivan in the Sunday Times pointed out</a>:</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify"><em>She has extraordinary negatives. She galvanises the conservative movement in ways no other Democrat can. Against McCain, she and she alone enables the Republicans to forget their deep internal divisions and unite. Nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 unites them as she does. The money she will raise for the Republicans is close to the amount they can raise for themselves.</em></div><div align="justify"><em>~</em></div><div align="justify">Sullivan believes Democrats should pick Obama.  I believe, as difficult as it is to swallow, that it would be better for the world for them to select Clinton.   Obama is a flake, he can speak well, he can inspire, but the substance behind what he says is absent.   The media's inability to quiz him on this has been shocking.</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">By contrast we know what Clinton believes in, and fortunately, on foreign policy, she is willing to be braver than Obama.  She is pro-Israel, she supports sanctions against Cuba, she supported a resolution calling Iran's Army of the Guards of National Revolution terrorists,  she voted in favour of authorising military force against Iraq and she stated on CNN that "<em>The first obligation of the president of the United States is to protect and defend the United States of America</em>".   For her many many flaws, I would feel slightly safer with Clinton than Obama.</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">Oh yes there are Republicans.  Romney the flip flopper, who once was seen with Margaret Thatcher, will not win.    John McCain, who is Republican lite, or a member of the rightwing end of the Democratic Party, will win the nomination.   The best you can hope for with him is that he wont reverse the Bush tax cuts.   woopee.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"> </div>

Worst comedy about Siamese twins ever!), Matt Damon was nevertheless voted sexiest man last year.</p>\u000A<p>He's probably best known for his action-man amnesiac spy in the <em>Bourne</em> trilogy of films and for playing the not-as-handsome-as-George-or-Brad sidekick in the <em>Ocean's</em> trilogy, but <a target="_blank" href="http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTzyU5MFgM"><strong>he was memorably spoofed in <em>Team America: World Police</em></strong></a> after his puppet turned out looking a bit brain-damaged, and the <em>South Park</em> guys decided to give him a voice to match.</p>\u000A<p>Well, in this startling example of how-not-to-tell-your-famous-TV-host-boyfriend-you're-cheating-on-him, Damon proves he might have a funny bone under that meaty frame. (Still can't sing though.)</p>\u000A<p>Check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=wnVJZkDuVBM"><strong>quite rude, yet well choreographed, clip of comedian Sarah Silverman breaking the news to her boyfriend of five years, Jimmy Kimmel, that she's xxxxing Matt Damon</strong></a>. It screened in the US last week during the fifth anniversary of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320037/"><strong><em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em></strong></a> show.  </p>\u000A<p>It's probably revenge on Matt's part for the number of times Kimmel has joked about running out of time to talk to Damon on his late-night show. <a target="_blank" href="http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=-PZNfOZXPJk"><strong>This clip from Kimmel's show in 2006 gives a bit of the Damon-Kimmel history</strong></a> and shows that Damon isn't afraid of sending himself up. (Also does anyone else think Damon looks surprisingly like Leo DiCaprio when he gets angry? I was impressed by the way his face actually turns red while he's ranting.)</p>\u000A<p>He can be quite amusing on other talk shows too, aside from notoriously dumping his girlfriend Minnie Driver live on Oprah, that is (maybe he was trying to avoid <a target="_blank" href="http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq0apHW6Ezw"><strong>an intense break-up scene like this one</strong></a>), he also does a mean impersonation of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/"><strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></a> as <a target="_blank" href="http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYD2cwMbpw&NR=1"><strong>demonstrated here on <em>Letterman</em></strong></a>.</p>

V<p>CIA director Michael Hayden has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7229169.stm">admitted to Congress</a> that the CIA <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2005/11/what-us-does-to-prisoners.html">waterboarded</a> suspected terrorists.  He made excuses and attempted to justify this unjustifiable act, but the fact remains: the CIA tortured prisoners, in contravention of both <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">international</a> and <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113C.html">US</a> law. The question now is what Congress is going to do about it.  And if the answer is anything less than commencing a full inquiry with the ultimate goal of putting everyone involved - from the torturers who held these screaming men down and poured water down their throats, to the doctors and psychologists who carefully checked their health and certified that they could be safely tortured, to the bureaucrats and lawyers who developed the policy and the legal excuses, to the politicians who personally approved it for each victim - behind bars for a very long time, then the entire US legislature becomes complicit.

V<p>Watching TV3 News last night, it appears clear Clark has blundered again with her boycott of the full Waitangi programme.</p>\u000A<p>John Key didn't just look comfortable at Waitangi - he looked Prime Ministerial, and was almost greeted as such, while Clark was missing in action.</p>\u000A<p>I did enjoy the only in NZ absurdity of Key being greeted by, and shaking hands with, Tame Iti who was arrested by the Police for allegedly being the leader of a group which aimed, amongst other things, to assassinate John Key.  However only once he had actually become PM! Could you imagine this in any other country.</p>\u000A<p>And even more bizarrely the costs of the Iti family going to Waitangi are being <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4388969a10.html">paid for by Television New Zealand</a>.</p>\u000A<p>Colin Espiner <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/politics/2008/02/05/clarks-no-show-at-waitangi-a-political-risk/">blogged yesterday</a> that Clark no-show was a risk</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Key, too, is on to a winner whatever happens. While National leaders have not always been welcome at Te Tii, Key is so easy-going and charming that he is unlikely to cop a faceful of mud like his predecessor. But even if he was abused, it simply plays into his favour. It shows that he\u2019s prepared to face up to criticism, while his counterpart is not.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>... Being the Prime Minister is a little different, of course. One does have to keep one\u2019s dignity. But I wonder whether this would have been the year to take the risk and return to Te Tii.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Audrey Young <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/blog/story.cfm?c_id=1501219&objectid=10490792&ref=rss">also blogged</a> about Key at Waitangi:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>It has been John Key's Waitangi so far today, not Helen Clark's who is just about to land in the Far North.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>And the bizarre spectacle of the PM who refuses to turn up, <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10490884">criticising the warm reception John Key received</a>. She just sounds bitter and small. And her lack of judgement comes through even more when she suggests that Key is not being honest about his agenda - because in fact the media have been reporting that Key has not been delivering a different message to a different audience, and despite the unpopularity has confirmed National policy is still to abolish the Maori seats and not abolish the Foreshore &amp; Seabed Act.</p>\u000A<p>Finally on radio this morning, I <a href="http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=131834">hear that John Key was asked to lead a prayer</a> of his own at the dawn service, as the PM wasn't there. Again this just makes him look like he is the PM, not just wanting to be.  Clark has surrendered her most important weapon - incumbency.</p>\u000A<p>The result of the next election is by no means already determined.  But Labour needs a error-free year, and so far there have been two blunders barely one month in.</p>

V<a href="http://coppersblog.blogspot.com/">Wasting Police Time by PC David Copperfield</a><br /><br />The most predictable thing about being involved in violent incidents is that they are completely unpredictable. <br />If I respond to a report of thirty youths fighting in the street with baseball bats, I can be fairly certain that on my arrival they will have dispersed and that a subsequent area search will prove negative.<br />On the other hand, if the local library assistant rings up to report a problem customer returning a book late, you just know that you\u2019re going to end up rolling around on the floor somewhere between Late Medieval History and Local Walks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />This book is an edited and tidied up version of coppersblog (see above link), which is just what it sounds like. The pseudonymous David Copperfield is a bit older than me, but out-curmudgeons me and makes it look easy: he is an old fashioned conservative, who believes the main problem with the justice system is that the prisons insist on releasing people after set lengths of time, instead of throwing away the key and letting them rot. Of course, given that my one major swing to the right is on the issue of crime, I pretty much agree with him. (That having been said; he does suffer from that particular myopia common to the middle classes of a certain age, of seeing crime committed by the young and/or poor as more serious than, you know, \u201Csmall\u201D crime; for example, he thinks that drunk and disorderly behaviour - more often than not committed by young morons - should be punished not with community service or periodic detention, rather with a jail sentence of no less than a year, but he also thinks that the punishment for drunk driving \u2013 essentially demerit points \u2013 is overly harsh on people who need their cars to go to work or to ferry their kids around...)<br /><br />Wasting Police Time has a bunch of opinions I don\u2019t agree with (cocooning those few that I do), but is a funny read, and does highlight many problems with policing in England \u2013 in fact, after the first edition of the book was released, questions were raised in Parliament by Opposition MPs who mentioned the book by name. And if nothing else, it possesses the following piece of wisdom:<br /><i>Drugs are fun and they make you feel good, and that\u2019s the extent of it. They do not \u2018cause\u2019 crime, though, any more than the existence of DVD players causes burglary, or the existence of short, ginger children causes bullying.</i>

To give the Reserve Bank Governor a second tool for fighting inflation, apart from raising interest rates.  It is to increase and decrease the petrol tax as a way to take the heat out of the economy without impacting exporters so much through high interest rates leading to a high dollar.</p>\u000A<p>I'd love to see some economic modelling on this proposal - how much does a change in petrol prices affect consumption and spending etc.</p>

V<p><img border="0" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/facebook-logo.jpg" width="100" height="35" />Yesterday marked <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>'s four year anniversary, or to look at it from the college perspective to which the site owes its success: Facebook graduated.  Washington Post assistant editor Rachel Dry, who was a senior at Harvard when Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com from his college dorm room on February 4, 2004, wrote a <a href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=feb72ee5-35c2-4896-8f4d-53100fad177c">commencement address</a> for <i>The New Republic</i>.  In it, Dry wonders if Facebook is taking "on the big inequities," as Bill Gates -- like Zuckerberg, a famous Harvard dropout -- urged in his commencement speech at the university last year.  We wondered the same thing.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Last week, we wrote about how <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, our <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_littleco_of_2007_twitter.php">Best Web LittleCo</a> of 2007, was quickly morphing into a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_rise_of_twitter_as_a_platform_for_serious_discourse.php">viable platform for serious discussion</a>.  One can see that happening today, as Super Tuesday primary elections take place across the US and people report and debate the results across Twitter.  But what about Facebook?  It was, afterall, our <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_bigco_of_2007.php">Best Web BigCo</a> of last year, one that we called a "company that really came of age this year; and [...] was the catalyst for some important Web trends."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>So we started wondering, could Facebook be a catalyst for something else: social change.  Dry mentions the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2318966938">Causes</a> application on Facebook, and groups which "connect thousands of people with common interests in humanitarian efforts."  Dry also talks about Facebook as an organizational tool, writing, "it's very easy for people to organize races for cures and alert their 547 nearest and dearest to articles on under-covered international tragedies."</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Facebook as a Vehicle for Social Change</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Indeed, on Facebook's graduation day a massive political protest in Colombia demonstrated Facebook's power to rally people to a cause.  Monday afternoon hundreds of thousands of Colombians took to the streets to protest the Marxist rebel group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia">FARC</a>.  Estimates on the crowd size ranged from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7225824.stm">500,000 to 2 million</a> people, which in and of itself isn't all that extraordinary -- millions of people get together to protest things all the time.  What is extraordinary, is that the protest was organized largely online through Facebook.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>A Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=7284103926">event page</a> created by protest organizers attracted over 106,000 confirmed guests with 18,000 maybes.  Almost 320,000 people were invited to the event, which demonstrates the ability for Facebook to get the word out to a massive number of people about social and political issues, quickly and effectively.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Another example of someone successfully using Facebook to enact change is the "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209409131">For Every 1,000 that join this group I will donate $1 for Darfur</a>," which was started by NYU student Marek Grodzicki.  The group has 424,000 members -- or $424 -- and Grodzicki is renewing his pledge for next year.  That may not be a lot of money, but it's almost half a million people who may now be more aware of an issue because a single person was able to reach them simply by announcing an altruistic act on Facebook and letting viral nature of social networking take over.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>But how common are examples like the FARC protest and the Darfur donation group?  It's really hard to tell, but what we can look at, is the effectiveness of the previously mentioned Causes application to raise money.  Just how charitable are Facebook users?  It turns out... not very.  Or at least, Facebook isn't prompting people to be charitable -- they may give plenty via other channels.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The Causes app, which allows anyone to create a cause and link it to a registered non-profit organization in the US or Canada, is one of the most popular on Facebook with 10.8 million registered users.  Because Causes interfaces with <a href="http://www.networkforgood.org/">Network for Good</a>, users can set up donation pages for thousands of charities, making it difficult to figure out how successful the application is as a whole.  However, looking at the top five campaigns by users, the results aren't so promising in terms of money raised:</p>\u000A\u000A<p>\u000A<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="600">\u000A<tbody>\u000A<tr>\u000A\u000A<td width="133" valign="top"><strong>Cause</strong></td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top"><strong>Users</strong></td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top"><strong>Donations</strong></td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top"><strong>Per User</strong></td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A<tr>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">Cancer Research</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">3,005,750</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$58,520</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$0.02</td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A<tr>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">Stop Global Warming</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">1,681,907</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$20,908</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$0.01</td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A<tr>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">Animal Rights</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">1,232,162</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$19,423</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$0.02</td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A<tr>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">Against Child Abuse</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">927,120</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$7,685</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$0.01</td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A<tr>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">Save Darfur</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">800,674</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$12,528</td>\u000A<td width="133" valign="top">$0.02</td>\u000A</tr>\u000A\u000A</tbody>\u000A</table>\u000A</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Clearly, these are important issues that a lot of people care about, but the application isn't doing much to inspire people to donate money to the causes.  An average of 1 to 2 cents per user isn't really anything to write home about.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Recently, the Causes app held a contest in which it gave out a $50,000 top prize to the organization that collected the most donations over a six week span.  That's a great idea because even organizations that don't land the $50,000 prize theoretically see an increase in donations.  The Giving Challenge began on December 14th and ended on February 1st, and though the official results won't be announced until later in the month, unofficial results predict the "Love Without Boundaries Foundation" as the winner of the top prize with 4,564 donors.  The participants in the Giving Challenge, who were mostly smaller charities, have much higher per user giving rates than the larger causes -- "Love Without Boundaries," for example, has a per user average over $15.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>But even while the challenge made the Causes app a successful fundraising tool for a handful of small charities, it also exposed the same sort of apathy (at least when it comes to giving) that the top causes seem to deal with.  As part of the competition, Causes gave out a daily $1,000 prize to the charity that had the most donors each day.  Except for the final week, when a couple of charities were making a big push for the top prize, the daily winner generally had under 100 donors.  That may seem like a lot, but with over 30 million people in the US and Canada over the age of 16, it still feels somewhat underwhelming.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>However, even if Causes isn't doing much to raise money, it is potentially doing a lot to raise awareness.  When just the top 5 causes reach about 7.5 million people, that's pretty powerful stuff. Further, each cause is given a group page that has familiar Facebook tools like a wall -- the Cancer Research cause, for example, has nearly 8,000 wall posts.  Giving 3 million people a platform to discuss something they're passionate about and raise awareness -- whether or not it leads to money donated -- points to Facebook's potential as a powerful social tool.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The bad news for Causes is that like other applications on Facebook, it has recently appeared susceptible to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/have_facebook_apps_peaked_in_popularity.php">app fatigue</a>.  It still has a huge installed based, but its active user base has been sliced to about 1/4th of what it was just a few months ago.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Conclusion</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>So is Facebook really a viable platform for social change?  I think it can be.  But like any new platform, we're still learning how to use it most successfully.  There have been some major successes -- like the FARC protest and the participants in the Causes Giving Challenge -- but also some less than stellar performances.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Facebook still has some growing up to do.  But as the user base gets older and more comfortable with the site, and as developers and organizers figure out the best ways to exploit Facebook to precipitate social change, it certainly could become a very important tool in any organizer's arsenal.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>What do you think?  Can Facebook be a serious platform for eliciting social change?  Or will it never be more than a place to play Scrabulous and poke friends?  Can it ever work for real fundraising?

V<h3> hungry hookers lose sex appeal</h3><br />Old sex workers are going home hungry because all the young underage girls are <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4388570a11.html?source=RSSnationalnews_20080205"> taking their business</a>.<br /><br />So says former sex worker Mamatere Strickland, who says she  assists  sex workers over 18 who want to leave the sex industry. <br /><br />Thats rubbish. They are going hungry because they spend all their money on drugs and  they can't or won't get jobs in parlours or outside the industry. They may habe less money because they are old and crusty.<br /><br />The problem is that Strickland is working with those who want to stay in the industry, not those who want to leave - which is why she she moans when their income levels drop.<br /><br />Keep the old hookers hungry - that`ll make  `em leave.  And at the same time, take the supply off the kids by arresting their clients and pimps.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigNews/~4/229321883" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday_%282008%29">super-duper Tuesday</a> (can they please get a better name than that?), the day on which most delegates in the US primaries are distributed.  By ths time tomorrow, there'll probably be a Republican nominee (thus effectively disenfranchising all the states which come after); thanks to the Democrats' embrace of proportional representation (or at least proportional distribution of delegates), they're unlikely to have an obvious winner, but the picture may become clearer.  No doubt they'll then have an attack of angst about how a robust contest to be the nominee is a sign of weakness and disunity or something - yet another problem with the US's ludicrous primary system.  Of course, if they had their primaries all at the same time, then it simply wouldn't be a problem.\u000A\u000A<p>For those who are interested, the BBC has an interactive guide to super-duper Tuesday <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/629/629/7223461.stm">here</a>.

VObama-file 8 <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-8-baltimore-communists-back.html">here</a><br /><br />The Communist Party USA has abandoned it's pretense of neutrality . <br /><br />It is throwing all its energies behind Barack Obama in the race for the Deomocratic Party presidential nomination.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />I'll let three top US Communists explain;<br /><br />According to <a href="http://paeditorsblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/will-progressives-respond.html">Terrie Albano</a>, editor of the CPUSA's People's Weekly World; <br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6LsGy_In5I/AAAAAAAABUk/HDqC8Z4NW7o/s1600-h/1551-150x150.jpg"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6LsGy_In5I/AAAAAAAABUk/HDqC8Z4NW7o/s200/1551-150x150.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5161947724429959058" /></a><br /><em>The movement that has exploded around Obama is so important. It's antiracist in essence. It's deep and broad and multiracial and multigenerational. It has insightful and sophisticated everyday people active in it. It's the cream rising to the top after the long horrendous period of the Bush administration and ultra right rule since Reagan.<br /><br />But even if Obama doesn't win and Hillary Clinton does, getting rid of any ultra rightist will take this country forward. And the movement around Obama will influence Clinton.<br /><br />This kind of upsurge comes around just once in a lifetime. I hope for all progressives - each of us - get involved. Don't stand on the sidelines. Be active. Don't let history pass you by.</em><br /><br />Pepe Lozano is a leader of the Chicago Young Communist League and is a People\u2019s Weekly World editorial board member.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6LtvC_In7I/AAAAAAAABU0/9obseloYx5s/s1600-h/m_471edfd9347a242e3ed43f8cd6de0ce6.jpg"><img src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6LtvC_In7I/AAAAAAAABU0/9obseloYx5s/s200/m_471edfd9347a242e3ed43f8cd6de0ce6.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5161949515431321522" /></a><br />Pepe Lozano's late father, Rudy Lozano, was a leading Chicago activist until his murder in 1983. Shortly before Lozano's death, newly elected Chicago Mayor, Harold Washington enlisted him as his liaison to the Latino community.<br /><br />Rudy Lozano played a big role in building the white "<em>progressive</em>"/Black/Latino coalition that elected Washington, the first black mayor of a major US city.<br /><br />This coalition was <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/10/chicagos-redblack-alliance-targets.html">organised by the CPUSA </a>and Chicago's socialist community that would later coalesce into the Chicago branch of the <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-2-barack-obama-was-endorsed.html">Democratic Socialists of America</a>.<br /><br />Washington was a <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-7-barack-obama-and.html">longtime supporter </a>of both groups and a probable secret member of the CPUSA. On taking office he proceeded to stack City Hall with communists, socialists and "<em>progressives</em>."<br /><br />This socialist "<em>golden age</em>" ended with Washington's death in office in 1987, but the alliance that elected him went on to elect <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/12/carol-moseley-braun-did-clinton-send-as.html">Carol Moseley Braun </a>to the US Senate in 1992.<br /><br />It has also supported Barack Obama at least since his successful State Senate race in 1996.<br /><br />According to Pepe Lozano;<br /><br /><em>African Americans and Mexican Americans \u2014 and really all Latinos \u2014 have much to gain in the 2008 elections. There are opportunities for both communities to work together and lead the growing movement for political change in Washington. <br /><br />The Black-Latino alliance is a major force that brings our communities closer in a world where racism, economic injustice and inequalities are deeply rooted throughout every aspect of our past and present. <br /><br />One example of how such unity brought progress for everyone was the campaign to elect Harold Washington mayor of Chicago...  <br /><br />Washington made history that year and put Chicago on the map due to the coalition of Black, Latino and white progressive forces that culminated in a record turnout of voters...<br /><br />The multiracial coalition for political unity that put Washington in office was in large part due to the Latino vote, which by itself had a record turnout of 62 percent, 82 percent of whom voted for Washington. <br /><br />Like Harold Washington, Sen. Barack Obama, on a much larger scale, could make political history by becoming the first African American president. And if it wasn\u2019t for Washington\u2019s example and the coalition forces in Chicago at that time, Obama might not be in the position he is in today.</em> <br /><br />While modern Latino's lean heavily towards Hillary Clinton, Lozano believes they can and should be turned Obama's way.<br /><br /><em>There have been some talk that Mexican Americans and other Latinos aren\u2019t going to vote for Obama, that we \u201Caren\u2019t ready\u201D to vote for a Black man or we have nothing in common. <br /><br />It is false to assume that Latinos are not prepared to vote for Obama. Or by extension that Latinos and Blacks have nothing in common. <br /><br />Latinos of all nationalities, U.S. born or immigrant, men and women, younger and older, have to be agents of change too and reach out to others. That\u2019s what was done during the historic Washington election \u2014 and the whole city won with that victory. <br /><br />In order to do that we must continue to fight for multiracial unity, and the African American and Latino communities together have to be in the forefront pushing a pro-people agenda. <br /><br />So let the reactionaries tremble at our unity in action. Together we have nothing to lose but our common oppression. And we have an election to win! </em><br /><br />Contributing editor to the CPUSA's Political Affairs, <a href="http://paeditorsblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/edwards-withdraws-some-thoughts-about.html">Norman Markowitz</a>, hopes that Obama will change the course of US politics.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6Lsgy_In6I/AAAAAAAABUs/zGJT0EU3isM/s1600-h/1929-275x275.jpg"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6Lsgy_In6I/AAAAAAAABUs/zGJT0EU3isM/s200/1929-275x275.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5161948171106557858" /></a><br /><em>Progressives seeking to build a national majority coalition that would both end and dismantle nearly thirty years of right-wing political power in the United States suffered a setback (that is all, I think, it can be called) with the apparent announcement that John Edwards is withdrawing his candidacy. <br /><br />Some, myself included, had hoped that Edwards would stay in, continue to win delegates, and form a coalition with Senator Obama's delegates at the convention to develop both a program and a presidential slate that would decisively defeat the right-wing Republicans and begin to enact in the 21st century programs like national public health care, substantial increases in minimum wages and other labor and social programs, funded through progressive taxation...</em><br /><br />Markowitz believes that Obama will repeat the 1930's. At that time the CPUSA flooded into Franklin Roosevelt's "<em>New Deal</em>" and pushed the USA far to the left.<br /><br /><em>Senator Obama has attracted people of progressive views, many of whom have been alienated from politics or are having their first experience with political activities, in a way that few candidates have for a very long time...<br /><br />He is far less of a known commodity, far more likely to bring into government independents and progressives from the mass organizations and the communities along with the traditional Democratic organization politicians, as Franklin Roosevelt did during the depression... <br /><br />But he can, I think, turn his status as an African American, a member of the minority group most stigmatized in U.S. history, into a very positive force, becoming in effect a real unifying leader for working class and progressive people of all colors, ethnicities and sexual orientations... <br /><br />All of these conjectures may be meaningless if Clinton wins a large victory in next week's "Super Tuesday," which is a good reason for progressives to both vote for and get out the vote for Obama...</em><br /><br />Obama-file 10 <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/02/obama-file-10-barack-obama-and.html">here</a>

V<p>DPF <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/02/once_again_nrt_makes_it_up.html">accuses me of misrepresenting him</a> in my latest post on <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2008/02/climate-change-strapped-chicken.html">the BRT's strapped chicken</a>. And looking at it again, he's right.  DPF did not explicitly say that he regarded the BRT's bogus study as proof positive that we should do nothing about climate change; instead, he simply said it implicitly.  Clearly, I was utterly mistaken in drawing the obvious and invited conclusion from the statements "there is a tradeoff", "we must look at the costs and benefits", and "the costs are too high", and I apologise unreservedly for misrepresenting DPF as an honest man who might stand by what he says, rather than a crawling spindoctor who hides behind plausible deniability in an effort to dogwhistle denial.\u000A\u000A<p>Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, and I look forward to DPF engaging with the actual substance of my post.

V<p>It\u2019s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/waitangiday-introduction"><strong>Waitangi Day</strong></a>. So I\u2019m going to make it easy \u2013 here are the remaining bad albums that I reviewed in 2007. I have already made a <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/blogonthetracks/2008/01/16/my-worst-of-2007-new-zealand-edition/"><strong>Worst of 2007: New Zealand Edition</strong></a></strong> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/blogonthetracks/2008/01/21/my-worst-of-2007-hip-hop-edition/"><strong>Worst of 2007: Hip-Hop Edition.</strong></a> Here are the leftovers, literally the scraps. The junk that infiltrated my stereo in and around some decent albums\u2026I think it\u2019s fun to revisit the nasty reviews. They\u2019re certainly fun to write, which is a good payoff when the album in question is not much fun to listen to. There are seven reviews here \u2013 all by artists that seem to have a rabid fan-base that took my reviews far too seriously. Anyway, hope you\u2019re having a day off work \u2013 I am, for once. So here\u2019s a final stroll through the worst of 2007.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Grand-National-John-Butler-Trio/dp/B000N3ST4S"><strong>The John Butler Trio<br />\u000AGrand National</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>Blame Ben Harper! Thanks to that slide-guitar charlatan we now have the antipodean version, replete with rope-head Rastafarian intentions and just brimming with earnest peace and love crap in his lyrics. Yup, John Butler is back \u2013 and with each and every album his fan base continues to grow. Good on him. His whole manufactured \u201Claidback approach\u201D (hey, it must be laidback if the dude plays guitar in a chair right?) gets on my nerves. JJ Cale\u2019s been strumming on the porch for years. No pretensions there. But Butler really grinds my gears with his hippie-dippie philosophy. He\u2019s the reverse of Mel Gibson \u2013 an American who wants to be Australian and wants to love all cultures, colours and creeds. At least Gibson, and I\u2019m not saying drunk-driving is cool, is being honest with who he really is. I heard most of the songs on <em>Grand National</em> debuted by Butler during his last tour. I hated them then, and they sound worse without a crowd to endorse his cod-reggae impersonations. There\u2019s no question the man can play his guitar, but on record he seems to want to hang back and be a Bob Marley figure for folk who think they\u2019ve unlocked the secret by reading The Secret.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rhapsody.com/linkinpark/14435697_minutestomidnight"><strong>Linkin Park<br />\u000AMinutes to Midnight</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>Linkin Park has always been awful \u2013 but at least, before, the band was genuinely original as well as being horrid. They made their name spearheading the Nu-Metal genre, mixing cornball rap with truly dire screaming and screeching over processed, rubbery guitars and passionless, metronomic rhythms. The music didn\u2019t even have an icy-cold heart that could be admired (Kraftwerk) it was just soulless and redundant. Remember those swinging cool compilations called <em>Music To Watch Girls By?</em> Linkin Park could well have called all of their albums to date <em>Music For Idiots To Drive Around To!</em> But now, with <em>Minutes to Midnight </em>the group commits the ultimate Nu-Metal no-no; they attempt to be taken seriously. Yes, lyrically, there has always been a cloying earnestness. But I assumed this band couldn\u2019t actually be for real. They had to be poking fun musically, right? Well, as we know, one should never assume. Linkin Park have now made asses of themselves for jumping bandwagons and attempting to deliver an emo/nu-metal album. Lyrics like \u201CI bring it out, bring it in deeper just to throw it away\u201D are about as close as Chester Bennington will ever get to winning a Pulitzer. And he still can\u2019t sing to save himself.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,4100652,00.html"><strong>Maroon 5<br />\u000AIt Won\u2019t Be Soon Before Long</strong></a></p>\u000A<p><em>Songs About Jane</em> made Maroon 5 in to huge pop stars \u2013 even though the album was released in 2002 and took until 2005 to really take off. That song <em>This Love</em> was catchy, but so is the common cold. Adam Levine\u2019s adenoidal voice and penchant for watery white-boy funk suggests some awful meeting of the minds between Counting Crows, Jamiroquai, Hootie &amp; The Blowfish and Live. Ew. But, people seem to love the sound. I struggle to see why, particularly on this sugary, sappy follow-up release. The first two songs will make Stevie Wonder bless his own visual impairment \u2013 or else surely he\u2019d instinctively reach out and slap Levine and band. From there, I waited for a sign \u2013 heck, even a tumbleweed! Something, anything \u2013 to break up the monotony. Awful lyrical clichés (\u201CI never knew perfection/until I heard you speak\u201D) slip in and around super-slick, veneer-sheen pop hooks. I could imagine this album being useful for people about to undergo surgery for testicular cancer; they\u2019d get an idea, instantly, of what it is like to go through life without, um, you know what\u2026</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Almost-Full-Deluxe-Limited/dp/B000PMLFRU"><strong>Paul McCartney<br />\u000AMemory Almost Full</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>Sure, Sir Macca might well have fathered half of Brit-Pop, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I want to hear a 65-year-old dad-type singing about one night stands. Is this conscious reinvention in the wake of outliving his own hymn to becoming a doddering 64-year-old? Most of <em>Memory Almost Full </em>plays out like a farewell to Wings, rather than a nod to that other band he was in. I\u2019ve always been a fan of McCartney \u2013 his last three albums (a loose trilogy of sorts from 1997\u2019s <em>Flaming Pie</em> through 2001\u2019s <em>Driving Rain</em> to 2005\u2019s <em>Chaos and Creation in the Backyard</em>) were so strong. Chaos went back to Wings \u2013 specifically <em>Band on the Run</em>. Here, <em>Memory Almost Full</em> is a half-baked mix of <em>Back to the Egg </em>and <em>McCartney II</em>; two albums that I like very much \u2013 but they stand out of time, in their own strange late-70s/early-80s bubble; reactions to punk and new-wave that are simultaneously blissfully unaware of the new musical concepts from the time. This new album just, mostly, sounds weird, despite the fact that the old boy can still write some melodic gems when he wants to. This is certainly the first McCartney album that should have fans questioning his contemporary validity.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertad_(album)"><strong>Velvet Revolver<br />\u000ALibertad</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>I wanted to like this album a lot. I thought that their debut, 2004\u2019s <em>Contraband</em>, was pretty good. I have one issue with Velvet Revolver, and I know I am not alone in this most obvious thought process: here is a band that should be a dream hard rock act, but will likely stumble under the weight of expectations. I mean this is essentially the last decent lineup of Guns\u2019n\u2019Roses with the voice of The Stone Temple Pilots doing the Axl role. Well, <em>Libertad </em>kicks off well, attempting to answer critics and suggesting the band has found its own sound (that aural Holy Grail for any post-Zeppelin hard rock act). Alas, it all falls away two-thirds of the way through the album and we get wannabe Rolling Stones circa-<em>Sticky Fingers </em>and, inexplicably, a glammed-up cover of ELO\u2019s <em>Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Head</em>. Fortunately, I have gotten Velvet Revolver out of my head \u2013 and more importantly away from my stereo. There\u2019ll be one more album from these guys, max. Let\u2019s face facts; they really are just the new Audioslave.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.avclub.com/content/music/korn"><strong>Korn<br />\u000A(Untitled)</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>It is unlikely that even the yoof of today could like Korn at this point \u2013 because an 18-year-old in 2007 would have been five years old when Korn debuted; you know back when you hated them for being the pillar of the burgeoning nu-metal scene? Or you loved them because your parents and un-cool friends hated them? Since then, we have had Marilyn Manson add layers of irony and dress-up (horror-)showmanship to this area of metal. We have had Limp Bizkit take white-boy hip-hop-laced metal to its pop-chart illogical extreme. And we have had Rage Against The Machine reform, to show how desperate musicians milking one idea truly are. So what hope is there, now that there\u2019s no hype, for Korn? I never really liked them, truth be told. But, occupational hazard, I have been aware of every album. This is their worst. Jonathan Davis seems to think that just by wishing himself to be the new Trent Reznor it will happen. Newsflash Jonathan: don\u2019t try to be cool and introspective and all untitled while you\u2019re still getting a major label to write the cheques that your butt can\u2019t cash.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7450079/a/Circus+Diablo.htm"><strong>Circus Diablo<br />\u000ACircus Diablo</strong></a></p>\u000A<p>Just this week I heard the very comforting news that The Cult has reformed, which means that Billy Duffy will be able to forget all about Circus Diablo. At least he has that luxury. I won\u2019t be able to forget hearing this. Alas. I got to my prince (a new album by The Cult sounds good) but the taste of kissing this frog will last longer than the third album by Audioslave or the second album by Velvet Revolver. In fact it may last just as long as having to watch a few songs by the band Supernova at their Wellington gig last year. This latest pointless excuse for attempted hard rock superannuation sees Ricky Warwick of The Almighty and Billy Morrison of Camp Freddy combining with Fuel\u2019s Brett Scallions and The Cult guitarist Duffy to recycle riffs and come nowhere close to their former recorded glories. Proving that this was just a marketing exercise the band even drafted in the hard-rock drummer to the stars Matt Sorum (The Cult, Guns\u2019n\u2019Roses, Velvet Revolver \u2013 isn\u2019t that an ever decreasing circle?) Circus Diablo even opened for Velvet Revolver \u2013 Sorum getting Charles Ruggiero to sub for him for live gigs.</p>

VWith traditionalist critics of liberalism such as <a href="http://ozconservative.blogspot.com/">Mark Richardson</a> persistently pointing out that the myth of the autonomous, self-authoring individual is one of keys to understanding liberal individualism, it's worth considering whether the principles of liberalism apply to organisations and societies as well.<br /><br />In the same way that liberal theory argues that individuals should be free to re-create themselves, according to their own whims and logic, liberal elites see themselves as being justified in continually changing organisations such as businesses, government departments and NGOs, according to rational criteria and liberal principles such as personal autonomy and egalitarianism.<br /><br />In the 19th Century, radical-liberal theorist Karl Marx noted the "bourgeois obsession with reform," which he attributed to the logical workings of capitalism. More recently, enlightenment critics such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ralston_Saul">John Ralston Saul</a> have pointed to the obsession western elites have with rational methodology, which they believe gives them the mandate to continually change and disrupt organisations, according to rational criteria, regardless of established customs, experience and common sense.<br /><br />In <em><a href="http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/saul.html">Voltaire's Bastards</a></em>, Saul argued that one result of the hubristic belief in rational methodology, is that managers tend to be rewarded according to adherence to methodology rather than actual results, both in the public and private sectors. Similarly, the word <em>managerialism</em> has entered the English language to identify arrogant psuedo-technocrats, who value generic qualifications and skills over specific expertise and practical experience.<br /><br />Anti-managerialism has a growing intellectual following in Britain, thanks to the micro-management excesses of Nu Labour. One British blogger who writes quite frequently on managerialism is Chris Dillow, author of the blog <em><a href="http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Stumbling and Mumbling</a></em>.<br /><br />The liberal nature of organisational reform in western countries is clearly apparent when western organisations are compared with those in other developed nations, such as Japan and Korea, which do not share the West's cultural history. Despite the unprecedented economic and technological change which Japan has experienced since 1945, the structure and habits of Japanese corporations have undergone relatively little change in the last 6o odd years.<br /><br />Highly successful firms such as Toyota and Sony continue to pay their senior managers modest salaries by western standards, and Japanese businesses still make many inexpensive, labour intensive products. By contrast, most western companies have long since shifted such manufacturing to the third world.<br /><br />Japanese firms are also cautious of egalitarian reforms such as opening-up management positions to women graduates and fast-tracing intelligent and ambitious graduates at the expense of experienced workers. Indeed, whole sectors of the Japanese economy, such as distribution and farming, are still largely run along traditional lines.<br /><br />Despite placing a high value on education, senior Japanese managers seem to put more emphasis on the importance of practical experience than their western counterparts.<br /><br />In contrast to the way organisations are conservatively managed in Japan, western organisations are subject to a whirlwind of change, to which many workers are increasingly numb.<br /><br />Diversity training, down-sizing, team-building exercises, political correctness, counseling, office-layout fads and incessantly changing business jargon are just some of the many questionable changes which today's western workforce is expected to put up with.<br /><br />Even organisations which are thought of as bastions of tradition, such as long-established churches, are subject to a level of change which would be unheard of in most cultures. The Church of England, for example, has been under considerable pressure to accept gay and female clergy as well as significant changes to its traditional religious services.<br /><br />The last 150 years have seen an enormous amount of change within western organisations, but the pace of change has intensified dramatically in the last 30-40 years, and an increasingly amount of that change has been of questionable practical benefit - which ties in with the intense degree of ideological social reform which has occurred in western society during this period.<br /><br />Given that most other cultures are very weary of such intense and rapid organisation change, the western managerial class may well be setting unrealistic expectations about how much anti-traditional change is possible or disirable.

VObama-file 9 <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/02/obama-file-9-us-communists-explain.html">here</a><br /><br />I'm sure most of my readers have seen Mafia funerals depicted on "<em>The Sopranos</em>" or "<em>The Godfather</em>" movies.<br /><br />The FBI is always there, photographing every dapper suited "<em>don</em>" and thuggish looking "<em>soldier</em>".<br /><br />In its war against the Mafia, the FBI knows that funerals are a great opportunity to learn more about the Mob's "<em>order of battle</em>", hierachy and internal relationships.<br /><br />Socialist funerals and memorial services can be a bit like that.<br /><br />In politics, as in other forms of crime, you may be judged by the company you keep.<br /><br />On March 13th 1998, Saul Mendelson, a lifelong socialist activist died in Chicago.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6PRvi_In8I/AAAAAAAABU8/BgEmh73-73Q/s1600-h/Saul2.jpg"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6PRvi_In8I/AAAAAAAABU8/BgEmh73-73Q/s200/Saul2.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5162200212672389058" /></a><br />Mendelson had been a member of various Trotskyist factions in the 1930s and '40s before joining the US Socialist Party.<br /><br />In 1958 Mendelson founded the <a href="http://www.chicagodsa.org/dthdin.html">Debs Dinner</a>, an ongoing annual event and highpoint of the Chicago socialist calendar.<br /><br />Over the years, the dinner has served as a focal point for Chicago's socialist, ex Trotskyist, ex-communist and left wing Democratic Party community.<br /><br />In 1983, many of the Debs Dinner crowd helped form a new Marxist organisation-<a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-7-barack-obama-and.html">Democratic Socialists of America </a>(DSA)<br /><br />The Debs Dinner crowd/DSA, <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/10/chicagos-redblack-alliance-targets.html">in conjunction </a>with the Communist Party, helped elect Chicago's leftist Mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Carol Mosely Braun to the US Senate in 1992 and Barack Obama to the Illinois State Senate in 1996 and to the US Senate in 2004.<br /><br />The same crowd <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-3-socialist-unionists.html">continues to back </a>Barack Obama in his current bid for the US presidency.<br /><br />Saul Mendelson was a leader of the Chicago DSA and personally played a large role in the election of Harold Washington.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.saulmendelson.com/memor329.html">Saul Mendelson Memorial Servi</a>ce was held on Sunday, March 29, 1998, at the First Unitarian Church, Chicago.<br /><br />According to Chicago DSA leader, <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/01/obama-file-7-barack-obama-and.html">Carl Marx Shier </a>(who addressed the gathering);<br /><br /><em>At the memorial service held at the 1st Unitarian Church on South Woodlawn, speaker after speaker recounted Saul's contributions. <br /><br />The service was ably MC'd by a retired colleague, Bob Clark. I spoke first and was followed by Saul's friend Deborah Meier, a MacArthur Genius Grant recipient who is now starting a new school in Boston. Amy Isaacs, National Director of the ADA, spoke of what Saul had meant on foreign affairs to the ADA. <br /><br />Other speakers included Senator Carol Moseley Braun, Alderman Toni Preckwinkle, State Senator Barak Obama, Illinois House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie and a good friend from New York, Myra Russell. <br /><br />The concluding remarks were made by an old friend, Harriet Lefley, who is now Professor of Psychology at the University of Miami Medical School.</em><br /><br />Deborah Meier was a former Trotsyist and Socialist Party comrade of Saul Mendelson's and a leader of Chicago and Boston DSA.<br /><br />Amy Isaacs was national director of <a href="http://www.adaction.org/about.htm">Americans for Democratic Action</a>.

V<div align="justify">In the 1980s and 1990s, funding for roads in New Zealand moved away from a pork barrel approach to one based on several key principles:</div><div align="justify">1.   All central government funding for roads sourced from taxes raised from road users (with an increasing proportion of such taxes dedicated to such funding);</div><div align="justify">2.   Removing direct political interference on decisions regarding which projects would proceed and would not proceed by appointing boards with specific independence to fund and develop projects that would meet goals such as economic efficiency and safety, within available budgets;</div><div align="justify">3.   Allocating funding for projects based upon advancing those with the best ratio of benefits to costs first, and delaying/deferring very high cost projects with relatively marginal benefits.  In short, allowing spending to be concentrated on maintenance and smaller projects that could be cost controlled, and allowed steady improvements to networks;</div><div align="justify">4.  Increasing road funding based upon steady growth of funds for new projects, not largescale increases that could place severe pressure on contracting costs.</div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">Since 1999 Labour has eroded these principles, significantly by:</div><div align="justify">1.  Introduced specific Crown taxpayer votes of funding for transport projects, in addition to dedicated road tax based funding (albeit it has also dedicated more and more road taxes to transport as well);</div><div align="justify">2. Introducing far more specificity in the outputs that the Minister of Transport expects from the crown agencies funding and building roading networks, and becoming significantly more interested in the timing of major road projects, particularly in Auckland;</div><div align="justify">3. Placing pressure on the government appointed boards to advance projects based upon "strategic considerations", being code for advancing lower value projects with high political profiles over higher value projects with lower political profiles.   None of this is explicit or public, but it involve phone calls to board chairs, conversations between politicians, board members and chief executives;</div><div align="justify">4.  Allowing goldplating and greenplating of major state highway projects with little justification based upon quantifiable returns or benefits (e.g. tunnel under Victoria Park viaduct), but high political profile.   </div><div align="justify">5.  Engaging politically driven official groups for special funding of transport in Auckland, Wellington, Bay of Plenty and Waikato to buy regional political support, and advance low value high cost projects that fail following the changes listed above.    </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">The last time you saw it explicitly was when Labour bought Winston Peters by using taxpayer funds to advance the Tauranga HarbourLink project, even though all the work beforehand indicated it could have been easily funded through tolls.    </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">Now you see it with <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4390442a19715.html">Dr Cullen about to bribe Auckland voters with their tax cut </a>- but by funding a heavily greenplated, expensive, and not particularly efficient new motorway.   This project has grown from around NZ$700 million in cost to well over NZ$1 billion, and its benefit cost ratio has always hovered below 1:1.   It cannot be funded from tolls as Transit's own analysis indicates motorists wouldn't pay to use it.   On top of that, while it could be built as a motorway at surface (with some noise barriers), what is being proposed, largely for an environmental argument (i hesitate to use the word reason), is a huge tunnel, adding enormously to the cost.   Before you say "it's done in Sydney", Sydney isn't a big volcanic basin - tunnelling is easy and cheap there, it isn't in Auckland.  </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">"but we need the road" you say?  Well, prove it.   Two other segments of the SH20 motorway are under construction now, extending it east towards the southern motorway bypassing Manukau and west towards Mt Roskill.  Both of these projects are good, and will make a big difference to traffic conditions around Auckland.   When completed they may indicate there is demand for improved roads between Mt Roskill and Waterview, and then?   Well, let the private sector finance and build the road, find a route, develop a design,  buy properties as necessary and then IT can toll it (and it would be fair for the proportion of fuel tax and road user charges paid when using the road are paid from the government to the owner).    Why should current taxpayers (not road users) fund a road that will be used for generations?  Why not let it be financed and the debt paid off over time from charges by those who will use it?  </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">It wont happen?  Well maybe the road isn't that necessary then.   Getting the government's state highway agency (Transit) with an insatiable appetite to spend money, to contract yet another huge road project in Auckland, right now, will further inflate road contracting costs.   Promises from the contracting sector that funding lots of roads at once will save money have proven nonsensical.   </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">So I'd let Transit fiddle around with determining a route, but that's about it - and finish the other two major projects on that corridor (plus duplicating the congested Mangere bridge, by tolling the new lanes).    Then Dr Cullen you can give New Zealanders a bigger tax cut.  Instead of spending $1.5 billion on a motorway of dubious economics, you might give that money to New Zealanders - $375 per man, woman and child would do a lot of good, wouldn't it?</div>

V<p><img border="0" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/web30logo.jpg" width="150" height="60" />On the UK's Guardian newspaper site today, writer Jemina Kiss suggested that Web 3.0 will be about recommendation.  "If web 2.0 could be summarized as interaction, web 3.0 must be about recommendation and personalization," <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/04/web20?gusrc=rss&feed=media">she wrote</a>.  Using Last.fm and Facebook's Beacon as an example, Kiss painted a picture of a web where personalized recommendation services can feed us information on new music, new products, and where to eat.  It's a marketers dream and it's really not far off from the definitions we've come up with in the past here on ReadWriteWeb.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>We've written about web 3.0 and attempted to define it many, many times here over the past year.  One of the common themes between almost all of the posts is that Web 3.0 and the vision of the Semantic Web are joined at the hip.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Last April, we held a contest asking readers for their <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/define_web_30_contest_winners.php">web 3.0 definitions</a>.  Our favorite came from <a href="http://www.outofrhythm.com/">Robert O'Brien</a>, who defined Web 3.0 as a "decentralized asynchronous me."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>"Web 1.0: Centralized Them. Web 2.0: Distributed Us. Web 3.0: Decentralized Me," he wrote. "[Web 3.0 is] about me when I don't want to participate in the world. It's about me when I want to have more control of my environment particularly who I let in. When my attention is stretched who/what do I pay attention to and who do I let pay attention to me. It is more effective communication for me!"</p>\u000A\u000A<p>What O'Brien was getting at is basically what Kiss was getting at: personalization and recommendation.  And that's the promise of the Semantic Web.  The easiest way to sell the Semantic Web vision to consumers is to talk about how it can make their lives easier.  When machines understand things in human terms, and can apply that knowledge to your attention data, we'll have a web that knows what we want and when we want it.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>ReadWriteWeb contributor Sramana Mitra put it another way on this blog last February, when she said that web 3.0 will be about <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/web_30_4cpvs.php">adding context to personalization</a>.  "Personalization has remained limited to some unsatisfactory efforts by the MyYahoo team, their primary disadvantage being the lack of a starting Context," she wrote.  "In Web 3.0, I predict, we are going to start seeing roll-ups. We will see a trunk that emerges from the Context, be it film (Netflix), music (iTunes), cooking / food, working women, single parents, ... and assembles the Web 3.0 formula that addresses the whole set of needs of a consumer in that Context."  Or in other words, web 3.0 will be about feeding you the information that you want, when you want it (in the proper context).</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Of course, the versioning of the Internet is kind of silly, and probably shouldn't keep going, but it is a fun way to look to the future and predict what we might be coming our way.  What do you think of Kiss's idea about web 3.0 being about recommendation and personalization?</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=UCFCfz"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=UCFCfz" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=XNWdDTE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=XNWdDTE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=bmN0SyE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=bmN0SyE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=b8a2wie"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=b8a2wie" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=bG9aPPe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=bG9aPPe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=RGhpWKe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=RGhpWKe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=0lD6rjE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=0lD6rjE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=ySkV05E"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=ySkV05E" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229484823" height="1" width="1" />

The statement indicates that Britney is often confused and acts like a child, while Sam takes advantage of her.<br /><br />Some of the lowlights from Lynne\u2019s statement dated 31st January are truly shocking. Lynne Spears alleges that Sam:<br /><ul><li>Crushes prescription drugs and puts them in her food </li><li>He then plies her with alcohol (a big no-no) </li><li>He is controlling Brit by removing her cell phones and chargers so she can\u2019t contact people </li><li>He is controlling her finances </li><li>He verbally abuses Brit </li><li>Lies to Brit (e.g. telling her that married boyfriend Adnan is gay)</li></ul><br /><br />According to Lynne Spears<br /><blockquote>Sam told me,\u201D You\u2019d better learn that I control everything. I control Howard Grossman, Britney\u2019s business manger. I control her attorney's and the security guards at the gate. They don\u2019t listen to Britney, they listen to me. That\u2019s why Jamie was gone tonight.\u201D<br /><br />At another point in the evening, Sam bragged to me that he is the one who receives Britney's checks and that one of them was for me. I told Sam that I hadn't gotten any checks from Britney. Sam then told me that they are in his car. He told me that if he weren't in the house to give Britney her medicine, she would kill herself. Then he said to me "If you try to get rid of me, she'll be dead and I'll piss on her grave."</blockquote><br />Huh. Perhaps Lufti would benefit from a wee stay in a psychiatric ward?<br /><br />The statement also mentions some heavy duty drugs including antipsychotics Risperdol and Seroquel, prescribed for bipolar and schizophrenia.<br /><br />The courts have granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting Lufti from being near Britney or contacting her in any way.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Sam had told Britney that she was an unfit mother, a piece of trash and a whore, that she cares more about Adnan, her current boyfriend, than she cares about her kids, and that she does not deserve her kids.<br /><br />The paparazzi reported to Sam and addressed him with great respect. They treated him like a general. He instructed them to get her back to the house. They later told Sam that Britney was on her way back.<br /><br />He told us that he had disposed of all of the phone chargers and had made the house phones unworkable.<br /><br />Sam hides the phones and tells her he has lost them. He also hides her dog, London. She looks for him all over the house crying and then Sam brings the dog from the hiding place and acts like her savior. </blockquote><br /><br />After Sam tells Brit that married boyfriend Adnan is gay<br /><blockquote>Britney then became very agitated and could not stop moving. She cleaned the house. She changed her clothes many times. She also changed her three dogs\u2019 clothes many times. Britney spoke to me in a tone and with the level of understanding of a very young girl. Britney then picked up a bottle of pill sand read part of the label and asked us, \u201CWhat does insomnia mean?\u201D Sam told her that the pills will help her stay awake.<br /><br />Sam told Jackie and me that he grinds up Britney\u2019s pills, which were on the counter and included Risperdol and Seroquel. He told us that he puts them in her food that that was the reason she had been quiet for the last three days (she had been sleeping.) He told us that the doctor who is treating her now is trying to get her into a sleep-induced coma so that they could then give her drugs to heal her brain.<br /><br />Sam then encouraged us to sit down on a sofa and do \u201Ctequila shots.\u201D Jackie and I said we did not want to. Britney seemed to follow our lead. Sam then got some wine out and said, \u201CLet\u2019s all do toasts with wine.\u201D Britney said that she didn\u2019t want to, she wanted a pretty glass. Sam found a glass with a stem and poured wine for Britney when we were not looking. Britney refused to drink her wine and asked to drink mine.<br /></blockquote><br />In a separate court action, Britney\u2019s father Jamie and lawyer Andrew Wallet have been granted temporary control of Britney\u2019s finances and are empowered to make decisions on her behalf, including medical decision. Britney, who is estranged from her dad, has been fighting the court order. A court-appointed lawyer, Samuel Ingham, interviewed Britney and said she\u2019s not in a fit state to understand the court proceedings or make a decision to appoint a conservator, so at this stage the decision remains.\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?a=A91phw"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?i=A91phw" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=bYiRJKE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=bYiRJKE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=yXMdJge"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=yXMdJge" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=afhqrte"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=afhqrte" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=1vV5RTe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=1vV5RTe" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewZealandRealityTv/~4/230057015" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><img src="http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00015/05RubbishGraphic_15022a.jpg" />\u000A\u000A<p>The <i>Independent</i> today has a piece on the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/the-worlds-rubbish-dump-a-garbage-tip-that-stretches-from-hawaii-to-japan-778016.html">Pacific trash vortex</a>, a vast area of the North Pacific which (thanks to a current system called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific gyre</a>) has become a floating trash dump.  But not just any trash - most stuff that ends up in the oceans biodegrades or sinks long before it makes its way to the gyre.  Instead, this area is full of our longest-lasting waste: plastic. An estimated 100 million tons of it, forming a soup that stretches from Hawaii to Japan.  Here's a description of the trash vortex from a piece on the <a href="http://www.bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/travel-leisure/Our_oceans_are_turning_into_plastic_are_we.shtml">pastic ocean</a>:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>It began with a line of plastic bags ghosting the surface, followed by an ugly tangle of junk: nets and ropes and bottles, motor-oil jugs and cracked bath toys, a mangled tarp. Tires. A traffic cone. Moore could not believe his eyes. Out here in this desolate place, the water was a stew of plastic crap. It was as though someone had taken the pristine seascape of his youth and swapped it for a landfill.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000AThe basic problem is that plastic is both light (or rather, dense) enough to float, and also essentially immortal.  Nothing eats plastic.  It's not broken down by the environment, except by physical processes which grind it into plastic dust ("biodegradable" plastic bags simply break down into smaller pieces of plastic).  So, it just piles up.  And unfortunately its piling up in the oceans.  This isn't just ugly - it's also a threat to the marine food chain.  Macroscopic plastic items such as bottletops and pens may be mistaken for food and eaten by fish and marine animals.  As plastic is indigestible, this is - eventually - fatal (there's a picture of the results at the top of <a href="http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/1103/1103_feature.html">this article</a>).  Microscopic fragments are eaten by plankton, with the same result.  But worse, plastics attract and concentrate complex organic pollutants like PCBs - meaning that our dumping of plastic in the oceans is slowly poisoning our food chain.  According to <i>The World Without Us</i>, there has already been one study correlating ingested plastics with PCBs in the fat tissue of puffins.  And there will likely be more as people start looking.  In short, plastics and chemical polluants are a toxic combination, and we're slowly poisoning ourselves with them.\u000A\u000A<p>What can we do about this?  Recycle, for one (though that's not particularly effective, as thanks to low melting temperatures you can't safely make new plastic bottles out of old ones).  Reduce usage as well (plastic supermarket bags are convenient, I know.  But they're also a long-lasting problem).  But most of all, <i>clean up after yourself</i>.  Don't let this shit get in the oceans.

VAfter detailing substantive reasons for supporting Obama (see also <a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2008/01/reasons-for-obama.html">my old post</a>) Hilzoy <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/02/obama-actually.html">concludes</a>:<br /><blockquote>I sometimes wonder why, exactly, people go on saying all this stuff about Obama lacking substance. Sometimes, I suspect it's just laziness, as in the case of this dKos story in which mcjoan, who is usually much better than this, lists a whole lot of questions she wishes the candidates would answer, apparently unaware that Obama (and, for all I know, Clinton), has already answered most of them. I suspect, though, that part of it might be the assumption that idealism is necessarily woolly and misty-eyed and all about singing Kumbaya, while realism is necessarily cynical and disillusioned.<br /><br />I have never believed this. There are certainly hard-bitten, cynical people who don't think particularly clearly about the world (Dick Cheney leaps to mind.) More to the point, I can't see any reason why there shouldn't also be people who are both genuinely idealistic and hardheaded at the same time. I suspect Obama is one of them. I do not for a moment imagine that he is perfect. (Cough, clean coal technology, cough cough.) But I do think that he's one of the best candidates I can remember, and that's good enough for me.</blockquote><br />Do read the whole thing, though. The details are important, and not the sort of thing that's covered in our dumbed-down mainstream media.<div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?a=ohf9JPE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?i=ohf9JPE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?a=7hNvBwE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?i=7hNvBwE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?a=xvgT6ae"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PhilosophyEtCetera?i=xvgT6ae" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div>

He has clearly been entrusted by the CPUSA to get out the Latino vote for Obama and the Democrats. <br /><br />Munoz has been working on turning Latinos to the Democrats for several years. <br /><br />Before the 2004 US presidential elections, the Southern California district of the CPUSA organised a \u201C<em>Socialism, Democracy, and Defeating Bush in 2004</em>,\u201D conference.<br /><br />Rosalio Muñoz, then CPUSA Southern California organiser stated, \u201C<em>It may be possible to trounce Bush in California and, if so, defeat right-wingers in Congress</em>.\u201D He added that ending right-wing control of both houses would create possibilities for real policy changes<br /><br />Munoz is also secretary of the CPUSA's Mexican American Equality Commission, the party organ dedicated to spreading CPUSA influence among Americans of Mexican descent.<br /><br />The Commission has influence in major trade unions, "<em>community organisations</em>" and Latino organisations across the US South West and California.<br /><br />From the <a href="http://www.pww.org/article/articleview/5325/1/218/">People's Weekly World 6th March 2004</a><br /><br /><em>TUCSON, Ariz. \u2013 Communist Party leaders and activists met here to discuss plans to bring out the broadest possible Mexican American and Latino vote to defeat the ultra right in the November elections and to strengthen the CPUSA\u2019s work among this section of the population. The participants at the meeting, held in the Salt of the Earth Labor College on May 15-16, came chiefly from the Southwest and the West Coast. <br /><br />Lorenzo Torrez, chair of the Party\u2019s Mexican American Equality Commission, reviewed the Commission\u2019s work in the recent period. He proposed the organizing of a left-center Latino coalition to mobilize the progressive sentiments of U.S. Latinos. <br />Rosalío Muñoz, CPUSA organizer in Southern California, reported on Latinos and the elections. He noted that the presidential race will be decided in key \u201Cbattleground states.\u201D A number of these, such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, are states where Mexican Americans are concentrated, he said. <br /><br />Muñoz proposed that the CPUSA put out literature in both Spanish and English explaining what is at stake for Latinos in the upcoming elections.</em><br /><br />In October 2007 Rosalio Munoz and another member of the CPUSA's Mexican American Equality Commission, Evelina Alarcon, played a big role in the annual <a href="http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:zXP-02-lb_gJ:www.latinocongreso.org/resolutions07approved.php+Latino+Congreso+rosalio+munoz&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=nz">Latino Congreso</a>. <br /><br />According to an article written for <a href="http://images.google.co.nz/imgres?imgurl=http://www.latinola.com/storyphoto/2007/10/11/10_11_1_005_21A.JPG&imgrefurl=http://www.latinola.com/story.php%3Fstory%3D4725&h=100&w=100&sz=26&hl=en&start=13&tbnid=-hEj0JowOdV7JM:&tbnh=82&tbnw=82&prev=/images%3Fq%3Drosalio%2Bmunoz%2B%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG">Communidad</a> by Munoz and a CPUSA colleague, Joelle Fishman;<br /><br /><em>Some 2000 Latino leaders and activists from throughout the United States came together in Los Angeles October 5-9 to iron out a plan of action and a social justice program of issues for the 2008 elections with the goal of bringing out 10 million Latino voters that can play a decisive role in the presidential and congressional elections.<br /><br />Latinos can be decisive in determining the presidential electoral in the key battle ground states of \u201CFlorida, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada \u2026 and congressional elections in twenty states\u201D that can change the political direction of the country said Antonio Gonzalez President of the Southwest Voter Registration project in opening up the 2nd National Latino Congreso convened by 10 national Latino organizations and hundreds of state and local groups from 22 states. <br /><br />\u201CWe are going to mobilize massively to reach record levels of Latino vote\u201D on the key issues of immigration reform, the war, greening cities, health care and climate change declared Gonzalez.

VSitting Dunedin South MP David Benson-Pope will likely spend the next few months looking for a new career, after losing the 2008 Labour Party nomination to local PR woman Clare Curran over the weekend.<br /><span>Quelle demage.</span><div><img src="http://www.davegeeonline.com/blog/08/02-05-dncurran.jpg" height="200" width="160" /></div>Curran, an elected Labour Party official, has been involved with the union movements in both Australia and New Zealand in recent years. She currently runs a small public relations/communications business in Dunedin with her partner.<br /><br />However, Clare Curran is more well known to the general public as the "woman who was awarded an uncontested contract with the Environment Ministry", at the request of Labour MP David Parker (Climate Change minister).  She was also described by his Private Secretary as Parker's "right-hand woman".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tv3.co.nz/VideoBrowseAll/PoliticsVideo/tabid/370/articleID/45028/cat/67/Default.aspx#video">TV3's coverage of the Dunedin selection result was rather ominous...</a> "The coffin lid is closing on the political career of David Benson-Pope"...<br /><br /><div><img src="http://www.davegeeonline.com/blog/08/02-05-dbptrio.jpg" height="184" width="404" /></div><br />Benson-Pope said after the 2005 election campaign that he thought media coverage of him was "way over the top", and that reporters and interviewers at both TV One and TV3 were "downright rude really".<br /><br />DBP has been the Labour MP for Dunedin South for almost nine years, following a period as a Labour Dunedin city councillor.  His de-selection follows a long run of embarrassing sagas, including Tennis-gate, Nightie-gate, Panty-gate, and Setchell-gate.<br /><br /><div><img src="http://www.davegeeonline.com/blog/08/02-05-dbpballexit.jpg" height="196" width="328" /></div><br />He eventually lost the backing of his Popular and competent Prime Minister, for his habit of being unable to tell the truth...  As one commentator put it, "less for <span>what</span> he had done, than for his <span>repeated inability to simply say</span> what he had done".<br /><br />As a <a href="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/?p=584">comment on the Labour-funded blog <span>The Standard</span></a> noted last year...<br /><blockquote>Dunedin South is a rock-solid Labour seat. It\u2019s hugely important organisationally: the LEC has one of the largest memberships\u2013at around 200, around 5% of Labour\u2019s entire membership\u2013and is asset-rich.<br /><br />Benson-Pope\u2019s electorate office is leased by the LEC to Parliamentary Services. It\u2019s a cash cow to the Party.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?a=VOQNxqE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?i=VOQNxqE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?a=Tkpuh5e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?i=Tkpuh5e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?a=Tttk3hE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/DaveGeeLifeFromRightField?i=Tttk3hE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div>

V<div align="justify">It should hardly be a surprise that recent coverage by the so-called peace loving left about Gaza retains a remarkable willingness to be blind to what the \u201Cgovernment\u201D in Gaza did to provoke Israel into sealing off its border.  <br />~<br />Let me remind you.   Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.  Withdrew, that\u2019s right pulled out as it has been asked since 1967.   It has no governance or military presence on this strip of land whatsoever.    It has removed the 9000 or so Jewish settlements, it has essentially done exactly what all of its opponents asked of it, regarding Gaza.   Now some argue that as Israel still controls the airspace, territorial waters and the borders with Israel that there is not complete control, but still, it is sovereign territory notwithstanding that.</div><div align="justify"><br />The Palestinian authority elections in 2006 saw Palestinian voters have a set of odious choices.  The main ones were either vote for Fatah, which supports peaceful co-existence with Israel, but has proven itself highly corrupt and administratively incompetent, or vote for Hamas, which wants to destroy Israel, but also has run schools, medical centres and tends to be far less prone to corruption.   There were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_legislative_election%2C_2006#Parties_participating">other parties offering alternatives </a>that were not Islamist and with no background on corruption.   Some of these could have provided a more reformist way forward, but no they chose Hamas.   By choosing Hamas, Palestinian voters chose war with Israel.<br />~<br />Without going into the detail about Hamas being effectively ousted from power in the West Bank, it remains that Hamas governs Gaza.   Israel\u2019s withdrawal means it is effectively the government of a rump Palestinian state of sorts.   What did Hamas do with this power?  It started firing rockets into Israel proper \u2013 you know, the country that is a UN member state, recognised by the vast majority of countries around the world including Egypt and Jordan.   Hamas decided that it was more worthwhile to attack Israel than to try to rebuild the shattered infrastructure and economy of Gaza, blighted by conflict over decades.  Why?  Because Hamas has little interest in the here and now, but every interest in fighting the \u201Cinfidels\u201D.<br />~<br />With over 4,000 rockets hitting Israel,  Israel could, on the basis of self defence, have reoccupied Gaza to root out those attacking it.   It has not.   What it has done is impose economic sanctions against the Hamas regime (Western countries including New Zealand have imposed such sanctions against countries that never laid a hand on it), built a barrier around Gaza (Israeli side not Egyptian) to restrict entry by terrorists into Israel, and put up a blockade against most imports that could aid and assist those attacking Israel.   It has also attacked from the air, sites from where rockets are being launched.  <br />~<br />If you listened to the views of Israel\u2019s critics it should have done none of this, but sit back and watched its people\u2019s homes be bombarded from a territory that Israel does not control.   It is notable that Egypt hasn\u2019t much tolerated the onslaught of Palestinians on its border either, but nobody blames Egypt do they?<br />~<br />Gaza, of course, is in an appalling state.   It has high population density (though lower than the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore), under developed and hardly a haven of prosperity.    Hamas could change that of course.   </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">It could stop attacking Israel and announce that Gaza will not be a base for attacks on Israel.   It might find economic sanctions get lifted.   It could seek to be outward looking and encourage Palestinians to seek trade as the way forward, and presumably their wealthy allies in Saudi Arabia might cough up some of their funds to finance simple infrastructure such as water, sewage, roads and electricity.   Of course they wont, because keeping Palestinians in poverty, angry and willing to fight to regain Jerusalem is exactly what their rich friends want.   The Palestinians are, in some respect, waging a proxy war for Iran and Saudi Arabia, one that makes them the losers.<br />~<br />In other words, there is a chance for Gaza to, with some effort, be transformed.   It is on a stretch of land that could become an attraction for tourists, it has horticulture and could become a free trade area, if only Hamas would also set up an independent judiciary that could enforce private property rights and contracts.   <br />~<br />I doubt whether it will, of course.   You see Hamas worships the afterlife, being Islamists.   It cultivates a culture that worships violence, celebrates death and honours those who give their lives to take those of others.   It actively recruits the young to sacrifice their lives for this cause of violence.  </div><div align="justify">~</div><div align="justify">Gaza could be so much more than a strip of hell.    Remember, Israel withdrew \u2013 it doesn\u2019t want it back \u2013 Palestinians have it, and they wont get Israel proper \u2013 ever.   If Gaza could succeed, then it would have positive effects on the West Bank, as Palestinians no longer act as victims, but set up a haven of prosperity, freedom and peace.   Doing that will open borders with Israel (and the world) more than any militancy ever could.</div>

VMySpace Platform Aims to Pick Up Where Facebook Left Off

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/myspaceplatlogo.jpg" />MySpace is launching its <a href="http://developer.myspace.com">developer platform</a> tomorrow and is going great lengths to highlight the ways it's different from the Facebook Platform.  That's ironic given that the dominant reaction to the Facebook Platform, from users at least if not the press, is that it's made the site too much like MySpace.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>None the less, there are some very interesting details available about the MySpace Platform.  After all, that is where the action is - <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/myspace_still_kicking.php">there's far more traffic to MySpace than Facebook</a>.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>A few highlights concerning the announcement include:<br />\u000A<ul><li>The best part of the announcement, as far as I'm concerned, is that MySpace apps will be allowed to include user admin/home page interfaces in addition to the part of the app that displays on the public facing profile your friends see.  It will be drag and drop, making your admin page a lot like an AJAX start page.  This is a big differentiator with Facebook so far.</li><br />\u000A<li>Developers will have one month to work on apps for the platform before users come in.  It's open to all, something MySpace says will "democratize" the process and prevent any early-access favoratism given to a handful of select companies on the Facebook Platform.</li><br />\u000A<li>User security is high priority and apps will be limited in their ability to access information.  Some critics allege that this is not the case at all over on Facebook, saying the Platform there gives total access to any app allowed to enter your profile.  That said, see our earlier post today on MySpace and Google.</li><br />\u000A<li>There are three APIs, the Google-lead OpenSocial being the primary one, some MySpace extensions for fields like favorite movies is another.  Though we've said that OpenSocial would be better described as OpenWidget, this instance at least will support social graph portability. Notable.  Note also though that this is one more platform deploying "OpenSocial - Plus."  Get enough Plusses in a room together and you have to wonder how much anyone is communicating with anyone else.</li><br />\u000A<li>MySpace's <a href="http://oauth.net">oAuth</a> support, via OpenSocial, will - I believe - make MySpace by far the biggest user of oAuth on the web.  That's great news for this open standards based authentication protocol.  More oAuth = more and safter mashups all around the web.</li></ul></p>\u000A\u000A<p>The least convincing reply to my questions came when I asked MySpace CTO Aber Whitcomb what would keep MySpace apps from being as annoying as the ones that have lead Facebook users to complain that Facebook is now too much like MySpace.  Whitcomb said that MySpace apps would be less annoying because developers would have more and equal time to develop them, this next month before users let in, and so there would be fewer trivial and poorly made apps.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Finally, I'd just like to add to this discussion that MySpace has solved the spam issue better than almost anyone else on the web.  Have you noticed?  At the end of September <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/myspace_captchas.php">MySpace installed a Captcha requirement</a> before a friend request could be sent and I feel like I haven't gotten a single spam request since then.  That's great!</p>\u000A\u000A<p>You can be snobby about your friends' noisy MySpace pages and the "classier" Facebook experience if you want, but many people are getting tired of the Facebook Platform already and it will be interesting to see what the leading social network online can do now.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=SBVk3m"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=SBVk3m" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=T28RWDE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=T28RWDE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=Cw26OaE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=Cw26OaE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=ZXDML3e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=ZXDML3e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=17mBnre"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=17mBnre" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=UW0TaQe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=UW0TaQe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=4PKzMnE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=4PKzMnE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=nPMDRmE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=nPMDRmE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229360211" height="1" width="1" />

Simple as that - no weasel words - they accept it, that is the pre-condition for the negotiations.<br /><br /><i>The Heads of Agreement aims to:<br />\u2022 recognise the unbroken, inalienable and enduring mana of the hap\u016B of Ngati Porou in relation to the <b>public foreshore and seabed</b> in their rohe...</i><br />- and they must accept that the lie perpetrated in the confiscation act that it is "public" (ie. Crown-owned) and not theirs.<br /><br /><span>The agreement describes eight instruments through which the mana of the hapu of Ngati Porou, in relation to the <b>public foreshore and seabed</b> in their rohe, would be recognised at law <b>in a way that is consistent with the object of the Foreshore and Seabed Act.</b>...</span><br />- the object being the confiscation of their property.  So they have to beg these would-be colonial masters for a quasi-waiver of the confiscation act provisions only so long as the original unjust, racist intent of the act - the act condemned in the UN report amongst others - is adhered to.  That is the basis of the deal.<br /><br /><i>1. A <b>Statutory Overlay</b> that recognises the special status [...] is recorded in key public documents such as district and regional plans and statements and is taken account of in consent processes under the Resource Management Act and the Marine Reserves Act.</i><br />- "notification" and "participation" in process only.<br /><br /><span>2. An <b>Environmental Covenant</b>, which will ensure that statutory plans prepared and administered by Gisborne District Council conform to a statement by Ng\u0101ti Porou on the sustainable management of natural and physical resources.</span><br />- the Gisborne District Council must "recognise and provide for the Environmental Covenant" in territorial customary rights areas and only "take into account" the covenant in all other areas. But any change due to it "will follow the normal public notification processes under the Resource Management Act 1991." - meaning it can be objected to presumably.<br /><br /><span>3. <b>Relationship Covenants</b> between the hapu of Ngati Porou and a number of Ministers</span><br />- perhaps funniest of all. They actually have the nerve to see this as some form of special acknowledgement.  Ha! Whopdee shit, a bit of face time with a minister.  The miners and the Tally Bros will get more time with the government players without any formal understandings of what courtesy amounts to. "The Crown will also write to the following agencies to encourage them to enter into relationship instruments with Ng\u0101ti Porou: Gisborne District Council and Transit New Zealand." That's right, they'll write a letter to them!  Talk about padding.<br /><br /><span>4. A <b>Fisheries Mechanism</b> that will allow Fisheries Management Committees to develop customary fisheries resource management plans and subsequent regulations (made by the Minister of Fisheries)</span><br />- this is all under the 1996 Fisheries Act anyway, so it's more smoke and mirrors and the illusion of concessions, but get this: if the minister, once the public have had their say (of course) determines "an undue adverse effect on existing fishing interests" ie. Pakeha or commercial interests then... computer says 'no'.<br /><br /><span>5. A <b>Wahi Tapu protection mechanism</b> that will give the supporting hapu the right to restrict or prohibit access to wahi tapu and wahi tapu areas within the public foreshore and seabed in their rohe.</span><br />- yeah, because tapu areas are public aren't they?  How can a tapu area be in a public area? Because the government made it public by the confiscation act so that they then have to <strike>negotiate</strike> beg for it to be recognised as tapu again from that much weaker position of having to establish that its origins "pre-date 1840" and the other "evidentiary" tests that the confiscation act stipulate.<br /><br /><span>6. A <b>protected customary activities mechanism</b> that will allow the supporting hapu the right to continue carrying out specified customary activities without resource consent in or on the public foreshore and seabed in their rohe.</span><br />- and here we start seeing this phrasing: <i>"The requirement for the relevant hapu to give approval for resource consent applications that may have a significant adverse effect on a protected customary activity does not apply to <b>certain accommodated matters."</b></i>  Whatever that means.  It is important because it potentially undoes this clause.  Oh, and once again, it's all in terms of the confiscation act's provisos anyway. Cullen has stated many times that all he considers this clause to mean is launching waka and collecting hangi stones.<br /><br /><span>7. A <b>pouwhenua instrument</b> that will give the hapu of Ngati Porou the right to erect Pouwhenua at culturally significant sites </span><br />- a form of boundary marker, but in this instance it has nothing more than "cultural significance".  It isn't allowed to mean anything to the Crown that would imply ownership by Ngati Porou.<br /><br /><span>8. A <b>placenames instrument</b> that will officially recognise traditional names or alter names of culturally significant areas.</span><br />- well, once again whoopee!  That would have happened anyway "in accordance with the New Zealand Geographic Board Act 1946."<br /><br /><span>Where specific territorial customary rights are recognised as part of this agreement the hapu signing this agreement will also have the following additional protections within those territorial customary rights areas:<br />\u2022 A Permission Right instrument that will provide the right to approve or withhold approval for any resource consent...<br />\u2022 An extended Fisheries Mechanism that provides the signatories with the ability to make by-laws under customary fishing regulations...<br />\u2022 An extended Environmental Covenant, which gives the signatories the ability to ensure all statutory plans that cover a territorial customary rights area recognise and provide for the approach of the hap\u016B to the sustainable management of physical and natural resources in that areas.</span><br />- well now that final bit sounds like we're getting somewhere. But once again the "Permission Right does not apply to certain <i>accommodated matters</i>" etc. etc.  It's all in the details and that has yet to be determined.<br /><br /><span>Once ratified, appointed representatives of [Ngati Porou] will file an application in the High Court for confirmation that the requirements for a finding by the High Court under section 96 of the Foreshore and Seabed Act have been satisfied.  Legislation will also be required to give effect to the Deed of Agreement once the territorial customary rights areas have been confirmed by the High Court.</span><br />- so all the rigmarole of the tilted playing field that the confiscation act created must still be gone through anyway.  Anyway.  Like what's the diff?  Not much at all it seems.<br /><br />As Harvey Keitel says in the beer ad "what you say 'no' to - defines you."  The mana of Ngati Porou leadership is on the line here along with the whole tribe (or at least the 40 of the 51 sub-tribes).  They aren't saying 'no' to the confiscation act.  And by extension they are saying 'no' to Maori solidarity.<br /><br /><b>------------UPDATE--------------</b><br />Watching Maori TV's flagship <i>Te Kaea</i> news programme I just heard the cross-eyed presenter, Scotty, exclaim at the end of the piece about the signing of the deal at parliament "Kamo te wehi! Ngati Porou" ("Awesome stuff, Ngati Porou") WTF!  Awesome is it, Scotty?  Try kupapa te wehi, Scotty. It's not just his eyesight that's all screwed up.  Why doesn't he just wear a Labour party badge while he's at it. Unbelievable.  Where was the critique from the Maori Party that the Pakeha networks had... you know... balance?  Don't they exist?  What's going on at MTS?  Is H2 running it on behalf of the PM?  Is their funding in jeopardy if they don't help the government?  Are they run by pro-Labour hacks?  I was going to make a pitch to put their news service online, but why would I want to transfer a Labour Party love-in onto the internet.  Ditch that idea. Very disappointing.  I'll have to keep a closer eye on them from now on.

I've just seen the pictures on TV of Cullen cuddling up to the Ngati Porou leadership.  This Iwi have been portrayed as kupapa (traitors) for their historic and continuing collaboration with the Crown - and this exercise will merely confirm that status in the minds of many observers.  Their thinking that they can get more out of the Crown by breaking solidarity with other tribes is unprincipled and the outcome highly questionable. If they think they will get anything substantially more than the "White Man's Touch" as the Crown determined property test for their own land, and the "White Man's Word" as the Crown determined process of over-riding that property test then they are in dreamland.  And if by a divine miracle they do get anything more than that then it automatically destroys all credibility the government has in having passed the raupatu in the first place. They keep voting for Horomia after all, what does that say about their political acumen?<br /><br />On that score I hope <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4387308a6160.html">Derek Fox kicks his arse.</a>  He got within 695 votes last time he stood - and will be odds on to take the seat off Horomia should he be nominated by the Maori Party.  The party's nominations from what I've gathered:<br /><br /><i>Candidate Selection Progress<br /><br /><b>Hauraki - Waikato</b><br />Selection  hui were held over a two week period in Pukekohe, Hamilton , Matamata, Huntly, Manurewa, Paeroa and Raglan.  On 27 November, Angeline Greensill was elected as the candidate to contest Hauraki-Waikato for the Maori Party.<br /><br /><b>Te Tai Tonga</b><br />Nominations opened on the 17th December 2007..  Nominations close on the 14th January 2008 (next Monday)..   Selection Hui will be held from the 10th - 15th February 2008<br /><br /><b>Ikaroa Rawhiti</b><br />Nominations opened on the 1 January 2008.  Nominations close on the 31st January 2008.  Selection Hui will be held from 2-8 March 2008.</i><br /><br />The Maori seats could all go their way if they continue to conduct themselves with vigour and independence over the next months.<br /><br />As for a National Party - Maori Party deal, yes it is possible, but only if the foreshore confiscation law is repealed.  That is the deal-maker/deal-breaker.  As my co-blogger mentioned this morning and as I have stated many times since the issue erupted in 2003: public access to all foreshore and seabed regardless of what property status it has is what is important to the public. Confiscating every square millimetre off Maori whilst protecting Pakeha rights in the same category so that Pakeha can get 80% of aquaculture areas and can build marinas etc. which over-rides Maori property, customary and other rights  will never be accepted because it is unconstitutional, unjust and racist.  We didn't need the UN to tell us that in their report because we already know, the government knows, Maori know, everyones knows: a Pakeha-run government can and will screw over Maori for as little a reason as mere bureaucratic convenience.  If Ngati Porou wants to attempt to bargain with a regime that treats them as <i>abos</i> instead of boycotting them and returning a staunch MP who will keep those bastards honest - then more fool them.  They are playing the divide-and-rule game by which all Crown governments have successfully managed to undermine the autonomy and protection that the Treaty afforded the communities that consented to it.<br /><br />As for the Nats - it is consistent with their property rights agenda and their pragmatism that they take that Maori Party deal.  Key must keep the red necks in his caucus in check to achieve it.  Not an easy task with characters like McCully and Nick Smith etc. etc. lurking in the shadows waiting for their opportunity to stumble out, voice their 1950s reactionary and racist venom and promptly lose the un-lose-able election.<br /><br /><b>---------UPDATE 6:30pm---------</b><br />In the <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/foreshore+and+seabed+heads+agreement+ng\u0101ti+porou+11">government press release</a> Cullen's quoted as commending "the good faith and sincerity with which Ng\u0101ti Porou have approached these negotiations" - which others might well characterise as a commendation of their ability to sell-out - to do their bidding, to play their game, to tow their line, to dance to their tune and fulfil their role as a bit player in Labour's manipulations of the Maori electorate.  <i>Praise from Caesar is an indictment indeed; when the world stands against that man and his greed.</i> To the negotiators they would doubtlessly think they are getting a good a deal as they can, but the timing especially is all carefully choreographed to Labour's agenda of "good news" leading up to Waitangi Day.<br /><br />On Radio New Zealand I'm hearing Tariana Turia reminding Dr Mahuika (a lead negotiator for Ngati Porou) of his original opposition to the confiscation bill and that negotiating with the Crown is a reversal of that policy.  (Of course by accepting the Crown's bullshit framework inside of the Act breaks the solidarity against it.)  Cullen says the agreement will be put into legislation - which will be a publicly dissected humiliation rather than any re-assertion of Ngati Porou mana - because we will all see just how little they get and how much they think they are worth.  And because Horomia is tangata whenua we'll see how this deal pans out for him in his constituency as it is presumed by him and Labour that it will be seen as him "delivering" and "walking the talk" and all those other stupendous waffly jabbered buzz-words that he spouts. And who, upon hearing Dr Mahuika's comments on One News tonight about the Maori Party, would say he is anything other than a Labour Party stooge?<br /><br />So what have they signed up to? - I'll post the critique once I've gone through the two documents issued today and <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/foreshore+and+seabed+heads+agreement+ng\u0101ti+porou+11">available as word doc's</a> on the govt. website.

V<p><i>This is a guest post by Aseem Kishore, a technology enthusiast and lead blogger for <a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/">Online-Tech-Tips</a>.</i></p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/podcast_feb08.jpg" />The US podcasting market has steadily been increasing in size over the last couple of years and is expected to double within the next two years to almost 38 million people, <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1005869&src=article1_newsltr">according to eMarketer</a>. With these kinds of numbers, podcasters and advertisers are starting to look into ways to generate more revenue through video ads.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>It is estimated that the total US podcast audience for 2007 is 18.5 million with an active podcast audience of 6.5 million. The 18.5 million number refers to individuals who have ever downloaded a podcast from anywhere. The "active" user base refers to individuals who have downloaded an average of one or more podcasts per week.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The active podcast audience is expected to grow to an impressive 25 million listeners by 2012 and advertisers are expected to spend close to $450 million by 2012.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>There are many reasons why podcasting is becoming more popular in the US at such a fast rate. Firstly, podcast content is easy to digest. Most podcasts that are downloaded are usually short and focus on specific topics or genres, making it easy for people to listen to exactly what they are interested in and skip the fluff. With professional high-quality content and no commercials, it's easy to see why people may prefer to view a podcast over a TV show.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Also, there is a much greater awareness and much more promotion for podcasting via large online news and media networks such as CNET, New York Times, and well-respected blogs <em>[Ed: see our own <a href="http://readwritetalk.com/">ReadWriteTalk</a> for example]</em>. Podcasts have also become part of many people's daily lives thanks to Apple's iPod and iTunes. With iTunes and the vast numbers of iPods, users are able to instantly and easily download podcasts onto their PC's or iPods, making watching a podcast almost as normal as listening to an MP3.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Following the success of Apple's iTunes, other major players have released portable media players that can play podcasts - such as Microsoft's Zune player and the Zune Marketplace - thereby increasing the podcast audience.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>On top of that, there has a been a prediction that within four years 40% of all video viewed will be outside of the television set. That's coming from a poll carried out by Jack Meyers and tracked by the firm Teletrax of 300 media executives.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The key questions will be whether the growth of the podcast audience will continue to increase at the current rate and will it be enough to attract large amounts of ad spending. Most podcasters make money through advertising on the pages/feeds that distribute the podcast, as well as embedding ads into the podcast itself. Sponsorships and subscription services are not as popular, but will grow as the podcasting market increases. </p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=HCuKr1"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=HCuKr1" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=7xj5ihE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=7xj5ihE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=muYKqWE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=muYKqWE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=Bumh08e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=Bumh08e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=RRSZnoe"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=RRSZnoe" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=b72MC7e"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=b72MC7e" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=secBKzE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=secBKzE" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=cS9NQLE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=cS9NQLE" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/229484824" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>Adolf Stroombergen of Infometrics has done a <a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/features/NZBR%20PEPANZ%20Carbon%20Mitigation%20Scenarios.pdf">study of the projected costs of carbon mitigation</a> for NZ households.  Dr Stroombergen is the chief economist at Infometrics and has done quite a bit of work in the climate change area - including for the Government's Emissions Trading Group. In fact his work is <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/economic+modelling+backs+emissions+trading+scheme">quoted approvingly by David Parker</a> just three months ago.  This report was commissioned by the New Zealand Business Roundtable and the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand.</p>\u000A<p>The Government has an aspirational goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.  However this report doesn't even try to measure what the cost of that would be. A very conservative target of restoring NZ's emission levels to 1990 levels by 2025 is studied.  And this is very conservative - NZ voted in Bali to reduce emission levels by 2020 to 25% - 40% below 1990 levels.  Our Kyoto target is to be at 1990 levels by 2012.</p>\u000A<p>The report looks at a business as usual scenario (based on growth of over 4% which is the Govt's target], and then a scenario where a domestic price of carbon is $300/tonne.  This reduces emissions by one third, but still leaves them 90% over 1990 levels. That shortfall has to be purchased on the international market at an estimated $100/tonne.</p>\u000A<p>The impact on various industries is massive.  Sheep farming would be 32% smaller than under business as usual.  Dairy farming 28% smaller and petroleum 27% smaller.</p>\u000A<p>A scenario C is also looked at, which assumes high economic growth itself leads to higher economic growth due to greater immigration and business confidence etc.  You need to be an economist to follow it in detail, but the key thing for most is the figures.  Under scenario C we reduce emissions by 40%, but they still exceed 1990 levels by 70% and and the cost of purchasing excess emissions on the world market is $7.2 billion.</p>\u000A<p>The summary of the research is:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>In summary, once the effects on aggregate investment, employment and productivity of investment uncertainty and transitional costs are taken into account, policy action to reduce New Zealand\u2019s emissions could lead to a fall in private consumption of 14% relative to BAU. This is about $7,000 per person in current prices or $19,000 per household. It also implies a doubling of electricity prices relative to 2007/08 and increases in petrol prices of more than 50% Nevertheless, despite these adverse effects on households, New Zealand\u2019s emission levels rise significantly rather than reduce relative to 1990 levels, calling into question the consistency of the government\u2019s twin goals of growth and carbon neutrality.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I have been saying for some months that we need more data on the benefits and costs of climate change and mitigation strategies, so that they can be weighed up.  This report provides some of that data.</p>\u000A<p>The <a href="http://feeds.beehive.govt.nz/release/minister+rejects+scaremongering+climate+change+report">response from David Parker</a> is very disappointing.  In fact it could almost result in a prosecution under the Fair Trading Act.  Parker claims:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>There is no mismatch between the goal of raising New Zealanders\u2019 standards of living and of becoming carbon neutral.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>This is of course nonsense. Absolute nonsense. Of course there is a tradeoff between economic growth and carbon emissions.  It is beyond dishonest for Parker to say there isn't. The issue before us is how to make that trade off, and to what degree.</p>\u000A<p>The  Stroombergen report is not, of course, gospel.  One can intelligently challenge the assumptions, the impact of technologies etc, and argue it will not be as bad as the $19,000 per household cost in the report.  But to argue that there is absolutely no mismatch or tradeoff between economic growth and reducing carbon emissions is almost the equivalent of arguing the Earth is flat.  It is an appalling response from the Climate Change Minister which just tries to con New Zealanders into thinking one can eliminate carbon emissions from our economy and not have it affect our standard of living.</p>

V<p></p>\u000A 	\u000A<p>I thought gardening might be soothing, but according to research released this week by <u><a href="http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2008/Press_Releases/02-03-08.html">Massey University's Centre for Public Health Research</a></u> workers in plant nurseries are four times more likely to develop the cancer Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, with apple and pear growing associated with a five-fold risk. The researchers attribute this risk to exposure to the chemical pesticides.  The research doesn't mention the rate of cancer amongst the pests, but I suspect that is quite high too.The reearchers also noted that hairdressers and sewing machinists faced an increased risk of bladder cancer, probably due to the chemical benzidine, which is common in hair and fabric dyes.</p>\u000A<p>Of course, the <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=184NTV2CE_c&NR=1">bloody unions</a></u> are up in arms about the whole thing, making <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200802041834/unions_to_campaign_about_job-cancer_links">unreasonable demands such as raised awareness of the issue and meetings</a> with the Department of Labour, Occupational Safety and Health and the ACC. Next thing you'll know consumers will be getting all uppity about whether their apples and pears actually need to be sprayed with cancerous pesticides or their clothes dipped in benzidine.</p>

VThe world's largest business grouping, and the biggest and most influential lobby in Washington, has <a href="http://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/association-news/us-chamber/newsdetails.aspx?News_id=49604">come out strongly behind </a>the US decision to join the P4 investment and financial services negotiations and plans to join the full agreement.  The US Chamber of Commerce is also wanting other APEC coutries outside the P4 agrrement to jump on board.  While the NZ US Council, Business NZ and the Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand can all be expected to be strong supporters, what is key at the end of the day is the support that exists in Washington.  This statement of support from the US Chamber of Commerce (over 3 million company members) is very important.

VI expect my co-blogger will be onto this soon enough.  I suppose it was just a matter of time...<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4388601a10.html">Dominion Post reports:</a> <i>Police have launched a homicide inquiry after a man died this morning during a confrontation with police in which pepper spray was used. [...] police used "light to moderate" force on the man as they tried to force him to the ground. "At this stage the officer noticed that the aggressive person was no longer resisting and it seems that at this time the person became unconscious and subsequently it seems he died to shortly after at scene."</i>

The act vested ownership of the foreshore and seabed in the Crown in response to a Court of Appeal ruling that allowed for the possibility of the Maori Land Court awarding freehold title in the foreshore and seabed. The act extinguished the right of tribes with exclusive, continuous use and occupation of coastal areas to claim customary title under common law in the High Court.</i><br /><br />This law was confiscation through legislation and my guess is that if the Maori Party meet privately with the National Party after the election and talk turkey, they could patch together a new Government, and my guess is the deal would be around repealing the Foreshore and Seabed Act while leaving the public access portion of the law, the Maori Party symbolically get what they want and National can claim they have protected public access of beaches. I have always called this election for Labour the Greens and the Maori Party, I now think, looking at the Maori Party\u2019s claims yesterday to take all 7 Maori seats, and Helen\u2019s continued spite by not going to Waitangi \u2013 I now think the National and the Maori Party could be the next Government of NZ.

VI've always regarded expanding NATO to include former Eastern Bloc countries as the height of stupidity.<br /><br />NATO is now hopelessly compromised by the hundreds of thousands of former Soviet bloc military and intelligence personnel now on "<em>our side</em>".<br /><br />Here's the latest example;<br /><br />From the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/03/europe/nato.php">International Herald Tribune</a><br /><br />BERLIN: The new chief of the Hungarian secret services, who spent six years at the KGB's academy in Moscow during the 1980s, has become chairman of NATO's intelligence committee, a development that diplomats said could compromise the security of the alliance.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6jYdS_IoDI/AAAAAAAABV0/u0qCGCIWJZo/s1600-h/Laborcs%2520Index.jpg"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_JtTfGekhAhY/R6jYdS_IoDI/AAAAAAAABV0/u0qCGCIWJZo/s200/Laborcs%2520Index.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5163614970604724274" /></a><br />Sandor Laborc, 49, was personally chosen by Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary as director of the country's counterintelligence National Security Office in December, after a bitter dispute between the governing coalition led by the Socialists - the former Communists - and the main opposition party, Fidesz.<br /><br />Laborc, a former Communist who was trained at the KGB's Dzerzhinsky Academy from 1983 to 1989, according to members of the national security committee in the Hungarian Parliament, had failed to win support from that committee, which oversees such appointments.<br /><br />Despite that, Gyurcsany and Gyorgy Szilvasy, the minister responsible for the intelligence services, pushed through the appointment.<br /><br />"<em>A decision by the National Security Committee has no binding effect</em>," Gyurcsany's office said in a statement issued in response to several written questions about Laborc from the International Herald Tribune. <em>"Gyorgy Szilvasy had the right to make a decision in his own capacity and advise the prime minister. He justified the recommendation by introducing General Laborc as someone with unquestioned professional credentials.</em>"<br /><br />Soon after his appointment, Laborc took over the chairmanship of NATO's special committee dealing with a wide range of intelligence issues, a rotating post that is held for a year and which fell to Hungary last month, alliance officials confirmed Friday.<br /><br />The committee, whose main task is to analyze and share intelligence, includes all of the secret service chiefs of NATO countries, who meet several times a year.<br /><br />Several NATO delegations, including the United States, whose ambassador was asked several times to comment on Laborc's appointment, declined to do so.<br /><br />James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said, "<em>We do not comment on personnel appointments or intelligence issues</em>."<br /><br />Some delegations said they had not been aware of Laborc's biography. His short curriculum vitae posted on the Hungarian security service's official Web site makes no mention of his time spent in Moscow. His past came to light when Szilvasy proposed him for the top intelligence job last autumn.<br /><br />NATO diplomats who did agree to discuss the appointment insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. They said that even if they had reservations about Laborc, they were in no position to block his appointment.<br /><br />"<em>NATO makes decisions on the basis of consensus</em>," said a senior diplomat from an East European country. "<em>If we had questioned this appointment then we would have to go further up to the top, in this case the Hungarian prime minister, to ask him about Laborc's past.</em>"<br /><br />Another diplomat, from a Western country, said, "<em>It would have taken one phone call by the U.S. ambassador to NATO to stop this appointment. It would have been a signal to other countries which might think they can still get away with this."</em><br /><br />In its statement, Gyurcsany's office said: "Not a single ambassador protested. Through diplomatic channels we received information that our partners are satisfied with the development of interagency cooperation."<br /><br />In practice, Laborc's appointment means that some NATO countries will be much more wary about sharing sensitive intelligence.<br /><br />"<em>Here we have a person who was trained by the KGB. I cannot assume that he has changed that much in his attitudes</em>," said another NATO diplomat, predicting that several important NATO countries would hold back on sharing intelligence. "<em>NATO, it must be said, is a very leaky organization</em>," the diplomat added.<br /><br />Indeed, NATO has been plagued with leaks. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic joined the alliance in 1999, and the rest of the former Warsaw Pact countries in 2004. After that expansion, military attachés from the Bulgarian delegation did not receive clearance to have access to a certain level of intelligence material.<br /><br /><em>"You could bet that anything we shared with Bulgaria inside NATO went straight to Moscow</em> ," said another senior Western European diplomat. "<em>The old Communist nomenklatura and secret services is still around in Romania and Bulgaria. But I must say the case of Hungary is very, very disappointing."</em><br /><br />Earlier, in the spring of 1999 when NATO was selecting bombing targets in its war to stop Serbian repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Greece, a member of NATO and the European Union but an ally of Serbia during the Balkan wars of the 1990s, repeatedly leaked alliance plans to Belgrade, NATO diplomats said Friday.<br /><br />In Hungary itself , Laborc's appointment has deepened the mistrust and polarization between the governing Socialists and the Fidesz opposition because of the way the prime minister by-passed the Parliament's national security committee.<br /><br />Although the committee's decision is not constitutionally binding, such committees have served as important instruments of democratic accountability since 1990, when the Communists were removed from power in Hungary.<br /><br />Moreover, until 2002 when the Socialists won the parliamentary elections, any Hungarian official who had served for more than a year in Moscow could not, for security reasons, be appointed to positions higher than a department head.<br /><br />"<em>At stake is the fundamental regard for the rule of law</em>," said Janos Martonyi, a former Hungarian foreign minister and Fidesz supporter. After a five-hour debate by the national security committee in late November, Laborc failed to win a majority of the 11 votes. No other candidate was offered by the government. The opposition declined to put forward a candidate.<br /><br />Fidesz claims that Gyurcsany, a former Communist youth leader turned millionaire who has close ties to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, has been politicizing the secret services for domestic reasons in order to keep track of the opposition, the media and trade unions. <br /><br />Hat Tip <a href="http://once-upon-a-time-in-the-west.blogspot.com/2008/02/euussr2-file-how-west-was-lost-natos.html">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>

VFrom Terry Zink's anti-spam blog:  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tzink/archive/2008/02/05/maybe-the-north-dakota-judge-should-watch-more-south-park.aspx">Maybe the North Dakota judge should watch more South Park...</a><br /><br />In a nutshell, Terry comments on the judge's ruling that David Ritz was guilty, in part, because he used tools the average user wouldn't have known about; as if expertise in a subject was criminal all by itself.<br /><br />Terry compares the case to an episode of <cite>South Park</cite> which is a parody of the TV series <cite>24</cite>, but in which the kids perform their investigation with the tools already in everybody's hands.<br /><br />The point being that maybe David knows what the whois database is, or how to do a zone transfer, while the average end-user (or North Dakota judge) has no clue, but the fact remains that these tools are in every internet user's hands and their use for what they were intended is not a criminal act.<br /><br />And while I'm on the subject, I'd like to remind my readers that David's defense fund still does not have the money required to defend against the oncoming criminal case, let alone to appeal this inane decision.<br /><br />Please take a minute and donate to David's defense fund, either at this <a href="http://sfldf.org/donations.html">web page</a> or by sending a check directly to his lawyers at:<br /><br /><span>David Ritz</span><br /><span>c/o Debra S.

VAccording to the final <a href="http://www.c-span.org/PDF/Zogby/Super_Tues_020508.pdf">Reuters/C-SPAN/ Zogby poll </a>(David Farrar doesn't rate Zogby, but we do) before the Super Tuesday votes are counted suggests the following:<br /><br /><em>The final day of polling before Super Tuesday was one of hardening positions in key races across the country, the latest Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby survey work shows. </em><br /><br /><em>Arizona Sen. John McCain continued to dominate among Republicans in the states polled in the surveys, with 50% or more supporting him in New Jersey and New York. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won less than half that in those states. </em><br /><br /><em>Romney continued to lead, however, in delegate-rich California, with 40% support in that state, to McCain\u2019s 33%. The Republican race was tighter in Missouri, with McCain ahead with 34% support, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in second with 27% and Romney third with 25% support. </em><br /><br /><em>On the Democratic side, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama continued to fight neck and neck for their party\u2019s voters and delegates. Obama solidified his lead in California, but Clinton pulled ahead in New Jersey, where the two had been tied in the previous poll. </em>

VEnough on US politics for the moment.  We don't think enough attention has been paid to last night's poll on TV3, which suggests that the last NZ Herald poll might have been a bit of a rogue, it showed up some trends, but the degree of movement away from National and toward Green was exaggerated.  If, like us, you missed TV3 news last night, you can <a href="http://www.tv3.co.nz/News/PoliticalNews/3NewspollshowsNatsstillwayoutinfront/tabid/419/articleID/45261/cat/67/Default.aspx#top">see the results here</a>.  In summary, National could govern alone on this result.

VThe United Kingdom now has a <a href="http://libertarianpartyonline.org/">Libertarian Party.</a><br /><br />But here are five reasons (presented by the winner of the Libertarian Alliance Chris Tame Prize)  why libertarians should NOT form a political party. Rather persuasive I thought;<br /><span><br />Being something of a contrarian, I choose to work up from the least important of my five reasons towards the most important.<br /><br />First, practical reasons.  Party politics is expensive, and we haven't got the money.  And it's time consuming too, and most of us haven't got the time\u2014nor many of us the necessary skills.<br /><br />Second, agreeing our manifesto would be an immensely difficult task.  Many policies favoured by one lot of us would alienate another lot of us.  We would have, not only disputes between purists and pragmatists, but also disputes between pragmatists of different stripes.  For example, there would be those who want to maintain some form of public welfare system, and favour draconian immigration restrictions, and those who want to ditch the welfare state entirely, and can therefore afford to be relaxed about immigration.<br /><br />Third, the only example in recent times of a new party gaining power in the islands called Britain was the Labour party\u2014and it took them 31 years, from 1893 to 1924.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't want to wait three decades or more for freedom.<br /><br />Fourth, a libertarian party won't work anyway.  I give you the sad story of the one libertarian party which, to my knowledge, has tasted real success\u2014the Movimiento Libertario in Costa Rica.  For many years, they did a great job.  They got voter support up to almost ten per cent.  They won 6 seats in a 57-seat parliament.  They even had a credible presidential candidate.  Then, in 2005, the party was taken over by so-called moderates.  The libertarians, who had worked so hard for the cause, were branded as radicals and purged from the party.  And the party now presents itself as a liberal party.  All of which leads to a harsh conclusion.  If a libertarian party fails, it fails.  And if it succeeds, it fails because it gets taken over and isn't libertarian any more.<br /><br />Fifth, and most important, politics is old hat.<br /><br />It is fashionable today, on the far left at least, to say that the state is out of date.  That, in an age of technology and nuclear weapons, the state or superstate, with its rulers and ruled, its wars, its re-distributory and confiscatory taxes and its bad laws, is no longer an appropriate way for we human beings to organize ourselves.  That new forms of society are needed.<br /><br />I suggest to you that these thinkers, uncomfortable though some of you may be with their ideas, are dead right.  Indeed, I go further.  I think the state and its political system are already collapsing around us.  And what we are living through now is a phase in the collapse, where the statists are desperately striving to shore up their blessed state.  That, I believe, is why they are falling over each other in their efforts to do as many bad things to us as they possibly can.<br /><br />But there is today, both in the islands called Britain and elsewhere, a rising tide of contempt for politics and politicians.  The political classes have spent most of the last two centuries trying to persuade us that they and their state are good for us.  But people\u2014and not just those already aware of the ideas of liberty\u2014have begun to see this for what it is, a lie.  More and more people are waking up from the anaesthetic, and starting to feel the pain.  I sense there's the potential for a big backlash building up out there.<br /><br />So, I think, to try to form a libertarian political party today would be a step in exactly the wrong direction.  Not only would we be trying to play the statists at their own political game.  But we would also be tying ourselves to a system that is doomed to fail.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/tactn/tactn030.htm">Read more</a>

V<p>The sad decline of No Right Turn continues.  In a <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2008/02/climate-change-strapped-chicken.html">post on the climate change report</a> he claims:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>DPF regards this as proof positive that the costs of mitigation are too high, and that therefore we should not bother at all to do anything about emissions.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>My <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2008/02/the_cost_of_carbon_mitigation.html">post is here</a>. The comments NRT attributes to me are invented.  In fact I said:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>I have been saying for some months that we need more data on the benefits and costs of climate change and mitigation strategies, so that they can be weighed up. This report provides some of that data.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>And later in the comments, I say:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>I do have real problems with a Govt line of not acknowledging the trade offs between growth and carbon. If the cost of reduced carbon emissions is 1% less economic growth, well then that may be the price one has to pay.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Nowhere have I said or suggested we do nothing about emissions. As the comment makes clear, I accept that we may have to live with reduced economic growth to reduce carbon emissions.  I don't think carbon neutrality is realistic (and let's face it that is just an election slogan from Helen) but some stabilisation and reduction is possible.</p>

VFran O'Sullivan <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/3/story.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10490883">analyses </a>the implications of yesterday's big announcement on the US joining the P4 investment and financial services negotiations, and the work that has begun on considering the possibility of joining the full Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership. Fran looks at the Australian angle and at the domestic political implications:<br /><br /><em>Greens co-leader Russel Norman was quick to rain on Goff's parade, calling on Labour to halt discussions on an investment treaty because of "sovereignty risks and issues dealing with environmental standards".</em><br /><em><br />Labour will be tempted to tread carefully around Norman because of electoral considerations. But frankly, this is one area where the Cabinet should show some courage and tell the Greens to take a jump.<br /><br />Goff has yet to take the proposal to Cabinet.<br /><br />At the end of the day Labour will be able to rely on strong support from National to secure this investment accord. The issue is simply too important to allow the tail to wag the dog here.</em>
