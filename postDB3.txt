p67

VThe Green Party is worried. Stung by recent low polling, they've figured out that its probably related to their support for Labour's hugely unpopular Electoral Finance Bill.<br /><br />Here's some extracts from a mass email sent out in the name of their <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/05/is-russel-norman-being-little.html">formerly?Trotskyist co-leader Russel Norman </a>and their <a href="http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/11/not-so-happy-valley-campers-green-party.html">anarchist MP, Metiria Turei</a>.<br /><br />Some comment from me in bold.<br /><br /><em>Protecting free speech and fairer elections<br />  <br />Please forward this email to as many people as you can to get the truth out there.<br />  <br />Many of you will have seen media reports and even paid advertising about the Electoral Finance Bill. Given the controversy around this Bill, we thought it was important that we wrote to you directly to explain the Green position.<br /> <br />The Electoral Finance Bill deals with one of the most important issues in our democracy - controls on the financing of election campaigns to protect the integrity of the ballot from the inequality of the wallet.</em><br /> <br /><em>The Greens have had many concerns about this Bill but we have chosen to work constructively with all parties. Our aim has been to improve the laws around campaign finance so that we<br />- have a fairer election system,<br />- ensure a more level playing field, and<br />- limit the corrupting influence of large secret donations on political parties.<br /> <br />The opponents of campaign finance reform<br /> <br />However, much of the publicity that has surrounded this Bill has been one-sided and, in fact, some has even been funded by wealthy donors who want the law to stay the same. They are trying to frighten New Zealanders by saying the Bill impacts on freedom of speech \u2013 this is not true.</em><br /><br /><strong>A little dig at private individual John Boscawen, who has funded the anti EFB campaign largely out of his own pocket.</strong><br /> <br /><em>Some media organisations have also been running an active and misleading campaign against the Bill. Journalists have contacted us to tell us that they oppose the misleading editorial line of their papers, but it is very difficult for them to get their views across.</em> <br /><br /><strong>Paranoia runs deep.</strong><br /><br /><em>So what does the Bill do (and what doesn't it do)?<br /> <br />* The Bill does not restrict freedom of speech \u2013 it just caps election campaign spending.<br />* Any person or group can purchase as much issue advertising as they want at any time.<br />* The Bill only places limits on how much election advertising political parties and others can purchase in an election year. That limit is $2.4m for political parties and $120,000 for any other group or individual.<br />* Any group or individual who purchases more than $12,000 in election ads must register with the Electoral Commission so there is transparency about who is involved in the election campaign.</em><br /><br /><strong>All this clearly inhibits free speech. One point the Greens fail to address is the real reasons donors should be able to remain anonymous-political revenge.<br /><br />We have anonymous voting, so that no voter need feel intimidated by a potentially vindictive victor. <br /><br />Many businesses in mixed economy New Zealand rely on government contracts for at least part of their income. Some business people already feel too intimidated to overtly support anti government parties. This bill will make that worse, potentially reducing funding for pro-business parties-a point I'm sure that was not overlooked by the bill's leftist framers.</strong><br /><br /><em>The spending caps exist to stop parties spending millions on campaigning and then needing to raise those millions in donations. Once parties rely on millions in donations they become heavily influenced by those who provide the money. The caps on political parties only work if there are caps on spending by other groups, otherwise the money goes into parallel campaigns.</em><br /><br /><strong>Having to raise money from donors-large or small, makes parties more responsive to the public. It engenders some humility. The alternative is open or covert state funding of political parties. This makes parties even less connected to the public and even more arrogant than they are now. </strong> <br /><br /><em>Closing the loopholes<br /> <br />Those who are most strongly opposed to the Bill took advantage of two major loopholes in our electoral financing regime in 2005.<br /> <br />- The first loophole enabled an organisation to work with a political party to run an almost identical campaign - known as parallel campaigning. This meant that the spending of the organisation was not capped even though it was a planned party election campaign.</em><br /><br /><strong>A clear dig at the Exclusive Brethren. Why should private individuals not be able to support anyone they like with their own tax paid cash?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Greenpeace has been supporting Green Party campaigns for years-using tax deductible donations, even though Greenpeace is a clearly political organisation and has openly advised against voting National in the past.</strong><br /> <br /><em>- The second loophole allowed for millions of dollars to be given to political parties without the public knowing who gave that money. Both the USA and Australian electoral systems have suffered from the corruption that arises from the secret funding of political parties.</em><br /><br /><strong>All paranoid speculation stated as fact. The New Zealand left has enjoyed huge financial and "volunteer" labour contributions from unions, Greenpeace etc, over many years. </strong> <br /><br /><em>The Greens are proud to assist in the closing of those two loopholes. This work will protect our electoral system from the threats of corruption that other similar democracies face.<br /> <br />It's far from perfect<br /> <br />However, we still have some outstanding issues with the Bill and with the process for these electoral law reforms. We are still pursing the option of a citizens' assembly which would allow for a number of randomly selected citizens to consider the issues of electoral finance and to find the best system for New Zealand. This system has been used successfully in Canada and we believe that the people of New Zealand should be able to make these decisions.<br /> <br />We have not achieved the ban on anonymous donations over $1000 that is our policy. However we have severely restricted the anonymous donations that can be received by both a third party and a political party. This is a major change in the law and goes someway towards a system that is open about who is funding political campaigns.<br /> <br />Changes the Greens achieved in the Bill<br /> <br />In summary, the Greens have made the following amendments:<br /> <br />Amendments to protect freedom of speech<br /> <br />1. Alter the definition of election advertising to protect issues advertising. This means that individuals and groups will be free to campaign on the issues that are important to them, regardless of whether one or more parties is also campaigning on the same issue. The Greens come from a campaigning background and we were determined to protect the right of groups to continue to campaign. For example, Greenpeace can continue to campaign against whaling, even though it is a campaign the Green Party has a profile on.</em><br /><br /><strong>Has Greenpeace, which has been extremely worried about this bill had a word in the Green Party's ear. No that couldn't possibly be. The Green Party is completely opposed to any covert influence on the electoral system.</strong><br /> <br /><em>2. Remove the requirement for a statutory declaration for spending less than the threshold. This means that people or groups don't have to sign a statutory declaration every time they spend money under the threshold for listing as a third party. It was an unnecessary burden that performed no useful function.<br /> <br />3. Lift the cap on election spending by non-party groups from $60,000 to $120,000. Many groups and individuals engage in election advertising during campaign year. This advertising encourages voters to support parties that adopt certain policy positions. The Bill as introduced limited this spending to $60,000. The Greens have supported amendments that increase this limit to $120,000, 5% of the $2.4m party limit and twice that originally proposed.<br /> <br />4. Lift the spending limit at which a group must list as a third party from $5000 to $12,000. This was important because many groups and people engage in election advertising through pamphlets, newsletters or community newspaper adverts. These ordinary election activities should not require a person or group to have to list as a third party where the spending is under $12,000.<br /> <br />5. Enable under 18 year olds and permanent residents to be able to list as a third party. We fought for the inclusion of this because it is a breach of the rights of a citizen to be prevented from engaging in election advertising activities simply because they are not old enough to vote. This change also means that groups will not be excluded from listing as a third party simply because one member is under 18 years old.<br /> <br />6. Protect donations to groups that are not for election purposes. This means that groups that register as third party participants in the election will not have to declare any donations that are not specifically for election purposes.<br />Groups are entitled to raise and collect money for their regular activities without interference. Only donations given specifically for electioneering will need to be disclosed.<br /> <br />Amendment to restrict anonymous donations<br /> <br />7. Severely restrict anonymous donations to political and third parties. The Greens insisted on an anonymous donations regime that will restrict Labour and National's ability to raise money through anonymous donations. Our policy is that all donations over $1000 should be identified as to the true source \u2013 they shouldn't be listed as anonymous nor should they be hidden behind secret trusts.<br /> <br />In negotiations over this bill we have made progress towards achieving our policy by introducing a system that will limit political parties to a total anonymous donations income, for donations over $1000, of 10% of their spending cap over the three year electoral cycle \u2013 this would cut Labour's anonymous donations income by at least half and National's secret trust income by about 90%. Labour and National don't like it but we make no apologies for this.</em><br /><br /><strong>Labour will make up the shortfall by giving more money to the unions, (which will launder it back to Labour) and by milking the state tit. National will be forced to support state funding of political parties. Any parties, like ACT, that are vehemently opposed to state funding will be disadvantaged.</strong> <br /><br /><em>In addition the money must be passed via the Electoral Commission to distance the parties from the process and donors must identify themselves to the Electoral Commission and give an assurance that they are not telling the parties about the donation on the sly. There is a limit of $36,000 on how much any one donor can give to a political party via this mechanism.<br /> <br />Best wishes<br /> <br />Metiria and Russel<br /> <br />Metiria is the Green MP responsible for the Bill in the House; Russel is Spokesperson on Electoral Matters.</em><br /><br /><strong>No doubt Greenpeace will be very happy about all their friends, the Green Party has done for them.</strong>

VLooks like the Pope has caused a bit of a storm with a whole range of people.  Andrei has <a href="http://briefingroom.typepad.com/the_briefing_room/2007/12/climate-change.html">a good post up on the details</a>.  Not PC is <a href="http://pc.blogspot.com/2007/12/sense-and-non-sense-from-would-be-world.html">a little surprised</a>, but then he puts it all down to the advisers the Pope must have.<br /><br />I'd just like to highlight a couple of statements that stood out to me.<br /><blockquote>... fears over man-made emissions melting the ice caps and causing a wave of unprecedented disasters were nothing more than <span>scare-mongering</span>.<br /><br />The German-born Pontiff said that while some concerns may be valid it was vital that the international community <span>based its policies on science rather than the dogma of the environmentalist movement</span>.</blockquote><span id="fullpost">This has been my position on climate change all along - I'm so glad I don't need to reconsider!<br /><blockquote>... the world needed to care for the environment but <span>not </span>to the point where the <span>welfare of animals and plants</span> was given a <span>greater priority</span> than that of mankind.</blockquote>Yes!  All those people that are so worried about whales or giant snails - are they at all perturbed by tiny human babies being sucked out of their mother's wombs?  Related to that, this Sunday marks 400,000 tiny human lives taken by abortion in NZ in the last 30 years.<br /><blockquote>"The human community cannot do without the service provided by the family. Where can young people gradually learn to savor the genuine 'taste\u201A' of peace better than in the original 'nest\u201A' which nature prepares for them."<br /><br />...<br /><br />"Whoever, even unknowingly, circumvents the institution of the family undermines peace in the entire community, national and international, since he weakens what is in effect the primary agency of peace. This point merits special reflection: Everything that serves to weaken the family based on the marriage of a man and a woman constitutes an objective obstacle on the road to peace."</blockquote>It has often been asked why gay marriage threatens traditional marriage.  As if someone else's marriage could threaten another's.  But the threat is not so much direct as indirect.  Once the notion of marriage, all it entails, all it's responsibilities are changed, marriage is weakened.  If it is considered that marriage is temporary, until one "partner" falls out of love, then marriage is weakened, and the children's ability to form life long relationships is weakened, as they've never seen how a life long relationship works.  If any man and his dog can get married, then marriage becomes a joke, something no one really needs or aspires to.  Yet marriage is fundamentally necessary in raising children and instilling values.  Without that, everything falls apart.  And we can see that happening quite clearly in NZ.<br /><br />Related Links: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=501316&amp;in_page_id=1811">Daily Mail</a>, <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/67983?page_no=3">New York Sun</a><br /></span>

The<br />\u000Acafe's smoking area at the rear of the cafe did not comply with new<br />\u000Asmoking laws because it was not open, the Health Ministry said.<br />\u000ACo-owner Roger Young said the rules were difficult to interpret."We're living in a police state. You can't do anything any more."</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I have a certain amount of sympathy for Mr. Young - as the owner of a small business, he is no doubt suffers under the many, many regulations, taxes and assorted rules and bylaws of the government and the city council.</p>\u000A<p>But does he seriously not see the irony of complaining about our "police state" when his cafe celebrates and endorses a <em>genuine</em> police state, and takes its name from one of the world's oldest tyrants?</p>\u000A<p>One of the things I hate about Wellington are the myriad of cafes celebrating communist Cuba. Fidel's of course, but also Cubita, Havana (although they have a great selection of NZ craft beers), Ernesto (featuring a shrine to that sadistic killer, Ernesto "Che" Guevara) and so on. I could also name Revolution Coffee and Pravda. No cafes celebrating Mao, Hitler or Pol Pot, of course.</p>\u000A<p>They can't point to the original naming of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba_Street,_Wellington">Cuba Street </a>as an excuse - the street was actually named for a sailing ship which visited Wellington a century before the Cuban revolution.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba_Street,_Wellington"><br />\u000A</a></p>

We crashed into it.</p>\u000A<p>A great big Mountain, an active volcano, and on the subcontinent to end all subcontinents. Something to see. As a great achievement of civilisation and man's grasp of nature, Air New Zealand used to fly tourists to Erebus for a look, then home again. Used to.</p>\u000A<p>In 1979 one such flight went horribly wrong. The crash scarred Erebus a little, but New Zealand a lot. All died. I had dinner with a bloke the other day and it came up that he was mates with one of those sent down to collect the corpses- he was severely effected. Back then (apart from 6mth olds like me) most everyone in NZ was related to, or knew someone, involved. As usual, when something goes wrong in New Zealand, we respond with a knee-jerk. No more flights to Erebus.</p>\u000A<p>Of course, what a proper capitalist country would do would be to get back on the horse.</p>\u000A<p>Australia, 28years latter, has done. It's not on their national psyche as it is ours, and thus they have trumped us. Again.\u000A</p>

V<p>The Parole Board has just released a legally defensible, but morally wrong decision to let Peter McNamara out on parole after Christmas. Previously they made a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/media-and-publications/decisions/mcnamara-peter-mana-28-08-07.html" title="Parole Board decision">morally correct but illogical decision</a> to  turn down his application for home detention. They kept him in prison for a 1989 rape until now, when he's served a bit over 2 years 6 months of the 7-year sentence.</p>\u000A<p>The issue was whether they could take into account the outrageousness of gutting a 7 year sentence, to refuse to release him, when he is not a threat to anyone in the community. They faced an impossible task. The government tried to write the law to obscure what they were telling the Board, but the original intention was clear -"<em>it's not your business to worry about justice, you must let them out if you feel they are not a risk. If that makes a mockery of sentencing, and insults the victims, that's not your problem".</em></p>\u000A<p>Select Committee changes confounded that simplicity. For example the Board is told to consider the interests of victims, but Labour and the Greens would not allow those interests to be defined or give them equal weight with the instruction to release. I do not apologise for the resulting confusion.</p>\u000A<p>The Board is bound by the Court of Appeal's decision in Reid et al v New Zealand Parole Board (CA 247/05) ...<em>"although considerations of general deterrence are relevant when setting the nominal sentence and minimum periods of imprisonment and in determining whether to grant leave to apply for home detention, they are not relevant when the Parole Board is considering applications for release on parole or home detention".</em></p>\u000A<p><font size="2">In the decision on home detention the Board raised something called 'personal deterrence' and the victim's views, and even the public concern for victims expressed in the 92% Withers petition for tougher sentencing to justify holding a man that nobody thinks will offend again.</font><font size="2">They were morally right, but the reasoning was crap.</font><font size="2">Now their reasoning is better but the outcome is wrong.</p>\u000A<p>There are arguments to get around the Court of Appeal decision. They could have said "<em>we are not letting you out because it would make a mockery of justice. If people believe that court-ordered sentences are nonsense, they will feel that crime does pay, that honesty is not the best policy, that only mugs obey the law. That loss of confidence in justice, in the basic fairness of the law is very dangerous to everyone in the community."</em></p>\u000A<p>They could have set it out like this (for appeal proofing purposes) " <em>we are not trying to deter bad people, we are trying to reassure good people - to reassure them that it is worth assisting the Police, that it is correct to teach your children that crime will not pay, to show that the long arm of the law will ensure the price of crime is paid".</em></p>\u000A<p>They could have had good academic support. The safety of the community is dictated by the crime rate, not individual release decisions. And there is strong evidence that the crime rate is most affected by what people believe is the prevailing norm. If it is generally not done to break the rules - few do. People on the crime margin are sensitive to what appears to be the prevailing climate. They should be the preoccupation of the system. Every element should be driven by its influence on those who could offend but do not (in low crime societies), or can and do (in high crime societies). Our religious forebears might have expressed it simply - the system should focus on those in temptation, not those who've made the decision to be bad.</p>\u000A<p>Instead ours is all focussed on those who have offended, and the vain task of turning them around once they have crossed the threshold. The international evidence says it is a waste of time.</p>\u000A<p>"Broken windows" is the shorthand name for the theory which underlay New York's dramatic crime turn-around. The police stopped concentrating on serious crime. Instead they enforced all the small laws (like those against shoplifting and begging, and leaping the turnstiles in subways, even jaywalking and littering. They insisted that graffiti be cleaned up immediately because it sent the message that rules do not apply. The result, in short order, was to cut every category of serious crime by more than 70% and the murder rate by 80% (in some years parts of provincial New Zealand now have a higher murder rate).</p>\u000A<p>Even if they could not step outside the NZ establishment orthodoxy enough to raise those arguments I would have respected the Parole Board much more if they'd simply said to the government in the decision- "<em>Change the unjust law. We are going to find every way we can not to apply it the way you want. We are sick of carrying the can for your dishonest criminal statutes. We will not tell the victim who is comforted by a 7 year sentence that sentencing is a calculated lie, a charade to be undone by parole</em>" .</p>\u000A<p>There is nothing unprecedented in a court or judicial body telling the poor litigants not to blame them when a law does not work, and asking Parliament to fix it.</p>\u000A<p>I have often excused the Parole Board for sad cases because the law is bad. But I've been too charitable. They've never called for reform.</p>\u000A<p>At the Graeme Burton enquiry they should have said <em>" We are ashamed of ourselves. There have been too many Graeme Burtons. We have not spoken out about the impossible law we are applying. From now on we will".</em></p>\u000A<p>In this McNamara decision they initially told a few insiders who can understand the code- <em>"this law is hopeless, and we are now going to ignore it". </em> Now I would not let them out of the dock.</p>\u000A<p>I hope this is appealed.</p>\u000A<p></font></p>

V<div><p>Answer: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7141651.stm">When it is a treaty</a>.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The ill fated EU constitution that was resoundedly rejected by European voters&nbsp; has reappeared in a reduced form and been signed into force as a treaty. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>The voters who turned out to oppose the &quot;constitution&quot; felt uncomfortable about handing over sovereignty to Brussels. But it will happen anyway.</p>\u000A\u000A<blockquote><p>The treaty is a slimmed-down version of the European constitution, with a more modest name and without any reference to EU symbols such as the flag and anthem.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>\u000A\u000AIt is meant to ease decision-making, by scrapping national vetoes in some 50 policy areas, including sensitive ones such as police and judicial co-operation. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>There will also be a foreign policy chief, controlling a big budget and thousands of diplomats and officials, and a permanent EU president appointed for up to five years.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>&quot;Ease decision making&quot; huh. What that really&nbsp; means is that if the people in a place like Slovakia (say) don't like what the gnomes in Brussels have decided for them tough cookies.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Ironically the actual signing of the treaty which will become known as the Treaty of Lisbon highlights some of the absurdities of EU&nbsp; politics.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Under the Treaty of Nice (2000) all&nbsp; summits of EU leaders must take place in Brussels.&nbsp; Thus after congregating in Lisbon for yesterday's formal signing (Portugal currently holds the rotating EU presidency)&nbsp; all the EU leaders and their foreign ministers decamped and flew to Brussels for the&nbsp; summit scheduled for today. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Which all seems rather hypocritical in these days of angst over mankind's carbon footprint.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Though to be fair the Prime ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands and\u000ALuxembourg did plane-pool as a gesture of social responsibility.</p></div>

This money is public&nbsp;property.</p>\u000A<p>Winston Peters has given the $158,000 due the taxpayer to a charity of his choosing. If any other taxpayer did this the Inland Revenue would pursue him for the&nbsp;debt.</p>\u000A<p>Mr Peters has not technically broken the law but only because he has used his party's votes in Parliament to help legalise the spending at the last election that the Auditor-General believes to be wrong. He has always disagreed with the Auditor-General's ruling and had wanted to contest it in the courts. But he has dropped this action, he says, because he could not have gotten a decision before the election next year and did not want to face the election accused of refusing to pay back "stolen&nbsp;money".</p>\u000A<p>So he has given it to the Starship. It is extraordinary that the hospital has accepted the money in these circumstances. It perhaps has not given enough thought to the&nbsp;implications.</p>\u000A<p>Advertisement<br />&nbsp;Advertisement</p>\u000A<p>It is letting itself be used for a petty political purpose. Mr Peters is using public sympathy for sick children to avoid a payment he believes his party should not have to make. Rather than accept the ruling against him and return the money to the public purse he has put the amount in a place he calculates to be beyond public&nbsp;reproach.</p>\u000A<p>The Starship is being cynically used and must know it. The hospital is part of the public health service. By accepting a donation that properly belongs to the public revenue it is complicit in an act of political manipulation and potentially depriving parts of the health service that may be less well endowed of&nbsp;funds.</p>\u000A<p>If the hospital means to keep this money it is obliged to explain to taxpayers why it believes the <span class="caps">NZ</span> First Party was entitled to dispose of the misspent election funds as it wished. This is not a political-legal dispute a public hospital would be wise to enter. The Starship would be well advised to return the cheque or, even better, pay it into the public accounts where it&nbsp;belongs.</p>\u000A<p>As for Mr Peters, the public doesn't seem surprised. Stunts of transparent nonsense have long been his preferred mode of operation. Most people have ceased to take him too seriously. He is excused for impish behaviour that would not be accepted from anyone else in public&nbsp;office.</p>\u000A<p>Seldom, though, has he displayed such contempt for public opinion and public finance as he has on this occasion. He freely admitted yesterday that the misuse of party allowances at the 2005 election was an issue "on which the court of public opinion had already made its final&nbsp;ruling".</p>\u000A<p>Since his party could not get a contrary declaration from the courts before the end of next year, he said, it proceeded to raise the amount the Auditor-General ruled that it owed but it was not willing to see the money disappear into the Government coffers.</div></p>\u000A<p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/" rel="nofollow">ScribeFire</a>.</p>

VAs someone who believes that too many people go to university these days, I was mildly pleased to hear that the University of Auckland is planning to restrict entry to all undergraduate courses for 2009 ("<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/metro/story.cfm?l_id=117&amp;objectid=10480136">University Senate back plan on numbers</a>," <em>New Zealand Herald</em> Dec 4, 2007).<br /><br />The university says it is making the changes to cope with a shortfall of money driven by cut backs in central government funding. Hence the university is planning to limit entry for art, education, science, theology and first year law. Not sure about the science limits, but the other cut backs sound excellent.<br /><br />Over the last twenty years, the value of a university degree has steadily declined, as more and more marginal students, who have neither the academic aptitude or the intellectual curiosity for university level courses, have drifted through the system to satisfy the government\u2019s crude targets for more "human capital" throughput.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as I read on, I realised that my initial impression, that for once common sense might trump ideology, was too good to be true.Predictably, the University deputy vice-Chancellor, Professor Raewyn Dalziel, says the institution plans to establish a taskforce to increase enrolment of under-represented students:<br /><br /><em>"The special admission schemes which set aside places for Maori, Pacific, and other under-represented communities operating in facilities which already restrict entry will be expanded."<br /><br /></em>If, by "under represented communities," the University means students from low-income families, then this looks to be another kick in the face for hard-working students and parents from lower-middle class families who tend to suffer the most from affirmative action policies.<br /><br />While low-income families receive generous government allowances, and upper middle class kids can usually rely on parental support, students from middle-income families are caught in the middle - too well-off to be eligible receive allowances, yet not rich enough to be able to rely on significant help from their parents. Now their opportunities to cover the cost of their courses, through scholarships or other subsidies, are likely to be further limited.<br /><br />As I\u2019ve said before, only indigenous minorities have a reasonable case for preferential treatment, and even then, they should have to accept cutbacks in quotas when others are having to make sacrifices.

V<p>Well, it looks like the US, China, Canada and Japan are going to hold Bali to ransom and prevent anything substantial from coming out of it. Not that I expected any grand outcome, just a decent framework to keep the post-Kyoto negotiations going. A couple of weeks ago, I posted a link to <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/Arctic.pdf" target="_blank">The Big Melt, Lessons from the Arctic Summer of 2007</a>. The folks over at <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/index.html" target="_blank">CarbonEquity</a> had already published a sequel, <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/targets.pdf" target="_blank">Target Practice</a>, which talks about the way we are setting our climate change targets and whether or not it makes sense to do it that way. They offer a couple of alternative possibilities.</p>\u000A<p>One such alternative is that if a complete melt of the Arctic Sea ice over summer, which has no effect on sea levels, could trigger a collapse of the Greenland ice sheet which <em>could</em> affect sea levels, maybe one target would be to keep the chance of a complete Arctic melt down to one in a million. NASA decided in the sixties that keeping the odds of a Saturn rocket crashing into population centres at 1 to 1 million was about right. Why not apply the same odds to our climate change debate? This eliminates the politics and injects a definable, science based outcome.</p>\u000A<p>So if we agree that losing Greenland's ice sheet is bad because it means 5 - 10 metres or so of sea level rise, and losing the Arctic Sea ice will likely trigger this, how about we keep the odds of a complete Arctic Sea meltdown at 1 to 1 million? Here's how we've been doing since 1979 and where we're headed now:</p>\u000A<p>\u000A\u000A</p>\u000A<p>If you have a moment, follow the link to <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/targets.pdf" target="_blank">Target Practice</a>. It's much more upbeat than <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/Arctic.pdf" target="_blank">The Big Melt.</a></p>

V<p>The campaign against ANZ for providing finance to Rimbunan Hijau in PNG, to enable RH to carry out illegal and unsustainable logging, has linked up with the campaign against ANZ as the potential financier to the Gunns pulp mill in Tasmania. We had protests in NZ while the greens in Oz had similar protests earlier this week. The Sydney Morning Herald had a good <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/greenies-rally-against-anz-over-logging/20071212-1goa.html">article </a>on it.</p>\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<h3>Greenies rally against ANZ over logging</h3>\u000A<ul>\u000A<li class="adSpot-toolbox">\u000A<h3>December 12, 2007 - 8:12PM</h3>\u000A</li>\u000A</ul>\u000A<p><!--articleDetails--></p>\u000A<p class="articleExtras-wrap"><!-- adSpotIsland --></p>\u000A<p id="adSpotIsland" class="islandad">Environmentalists staged protests outside ANZ Bank branches in Australia and New Zealand calling on the bank not to fund logging operations in Tasmania and Papua New Guinea.</p>\u000A<p>The Wilderness Society of Tasmania and New Zealand's Green Party organised the protests to coincide with the United Nations climate change conference in Bali, Indonesia.</p>\u000A<p>Wilderness Society spokesman Paul Oosting said logging and land-clearing in Tasmania already accounted for at least 30 per cent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions and a proposed new pulp mill was conservatively estimated to add two per cent to Australia's annual emissions.</p>\u000A<p>"Both governments and banks have a global responsibility to help cut greenhouse gas emissions," he said.</p>\u000A<p>"This starts with refusing support for destructive logging practices and moving to help protect intact native forests."</p>\u000A<p>In New Zealand, Green Party co-leader Russel Norman called on customers to pressure the ANZ banking group, which has been named as a potential financier of the proposed pulp mill, not to "provide finance for forest destruction" in the state.</p>\u000A<p>Oosting said Tasmanian forests were some of the most "carbon rich" in the world and ancient trees 70-80 metres tall were being felled in the state's Styx Valley, in a woodchip-driven logging operation.</p>\u000A<p>He said the proposed new pulp mill would consume up to 4.5 million tonnes of wood a year, creating greenhouse gases equivalent to putting an extra 2.3 million cars on the road annually.</p>\u000A<p>Oosting said the Malaysian company Rimbunan Hijau, an ANZ client, was carrying out logging in Papua New Guinea that had been condemned internationally.</p>\u000A<p>Australian Greens leader Bob Brown said: "ANZ has a fantastic opportunity to behave as a good corporate citizen. It must take a strong stance against bankrolling the disastrous proposed Tasmanian mill and refuse to support the unsustainable and illegal logging of rainforests in Papua New Guinea."</p></blockquote>\u000A<p><!-- Copyright Sign --></p>

V<p>Dunedin football team, the Melchester Rovers is the first team on this side of the world to exclusively use fair trade footballs for training and match play. Dave Peck, the promoter of fair trade sports balls and a Green Party member, plays in goal for Melchester and was interested to discover that fair trade balls cost the same to supply as traditional balls, except for the profit going to the communities that make them rather than the sports stars who promote them.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://blog.greens.org.nz/wp-content/melchester-photo-jul-07.jpg" alt="Melchester Rovers 07" /></p>\u000A<p>The production of soccer balls has long suffered from the abusive use of child labour in sweatshops.  Children are used by many of the factories that manufacture balls as cheaper, have small hands and eyesight that has not been ruined by stitching.</p>\u000A<p>Peck, the Rovers' British import, says he was given the task of replacing a ball that got lost in the harbour - not an issue that Cristiano Ronaldo faces but common enough in Dunedin.</p>\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<p>\u201CI searched for a local supplier of fair trade balls and after not finding one locally, I then discovered a supplier in Australia, to whom I contacted to order some training balls. A conversation eschewed and at the end of it I'd started importing them, with a shipment of a hundred balls heading over!\u201D</p>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A<p>According to <a href="http://www.etiko.co.nz/">Etiko</a>, the supplier of the balls, several challenges were posed when developing fair trade balls:</p>\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<p>\u201CInitially child labour had to be stopped while preventing children from seeking work in other areas.  Another challenge was to maintain the right of women to work.  In strict Islamic society football stitching is one of the few jobs readily available to women, as it can be done from home...</p>\u000A<p>The answer to the problem of child labour is surprisingly simple: pay workers properly! If parents of several children are forced to work for for wages that are so low they cannot support their families, then clearly children will be encouraged to work to bolster the family income... no parent would make their child work if they did not have to.\u201D</p>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A<p align="center"><img src="http://blog.greens.org.nz/wp-content/beckham-flyer-etiko-aug-07.jpg" alt="Etiko Beckham Flyer" /></p>

V<p>Negotiators are Currently meeting at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali in an effort to establish the framework for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  But as with previous talks on the subject, we're seeing the usual games, with the US (aided and abetted by its reliable stooges Canada and Japan) <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10482316">attempting to disrupt the talks</a> and prevent them from agreeing to a ballpark target for future emissions reductions by developed nations of 25 - 40%.  They're also objecting to a statementthat emissions must peak and decline within a decade.  Both positions are mainstream scientific opinion, endorsed by the IPCC in its latest report, which makes a mockery of the US's claim to want "science driven" policy.\u000A\u000A<p>The US does this at every meeting.  They play no constructive role in negotiations, but attempt to wreck them and prevent others from reaching any positive agreement.  It's time we stopped indulging them, or pandering to their belief in their own relevance.  The US is run by a lame-duck President leading a lame-duck administration, and everyone knows policy will change when he leaves office in January 2009.  If the current US administration will not participate meaningfully in these negotiations, then the rest of the world should simply work around them, reach a strong agreement, and let Bush's successor join up when they enter office.

Its success has major implications for the Christchurch based polar operation which each summer despatches military aircraft southward. A statement from the Australian Antarctic Division said the Airbus A319 landed on the purpose-built Wilkins Runway, around 70 kilometres from Casey station, late on Sunday night and returned to Hobart early on Monday.</i> <br /><br />Ummm, why are the bloody Australians opening up Antarctica to Commercial aircraft with specially built runways? Isn\u2019t this type of development the exact opposite of what we should be doing when we look at the effects of global warming? So as a comparison, I wonder what\u2019s happening in the Arctic right now? <br /><br /><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4322897a12.html">Arctic ice cap vanishing at record rate</a><br /><i>Arctic ice at the North Pole melted at a record rate in the summer of 2007, the latest sign that climate change has accelerated in recent years, climate scientists said. "In 2007, we had off-the-charts warming," Michael Steele, an oceanographer at the University of Washington, said at the 2007 meeting of the American Geophysical Union, where 15,000 researchers have gathered to discuss earthquakes, water resources, and climate change. It was an ominous summer for the Arctic region, where for the first time in recorded history, ships sailed across the Arctic Ocean in water that had been part of the polar ice cap, said Donald Perovich of the US Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in New Hampshire.<br />While in the summer of 1980 the North Pole was covered by an ice sheath about the size of the continental United States, this summer the ice would not have covered the states west of the Mississippi River, he added.</i> <br /><br />And the Australian reaction to that is to open Antarctica up to commercial aircraft?

Opponents to police being issued with Tasers are ignoring the realities of modern policing, Mr O'Connor said. Staff are to report to Mr Broad by today on how their 12-month Taser stun guns trial went, and he will make the final decision on their use. Last month a United Nations report described them as a "form of torture". The UN Committee Against Torture said it was worried by the use of Tasers.</i><br /><br />The issue is do you want the Police to have unchecked access to a weapon that isn\u2019t \u2018lethal\u2019 but can be used by Police on whom they like with no independent committee over-seeing Police use. Our slower friends in the community will howl that it\u2019s safer to be shot by a taser than a gun, but those slower friends miss the whole point which is that we don\u2019t have a way of keeping the Police in check if we give them tasers, at this point our slower friends mumble something about you being anti-police and they rock quietly in the corner muttering angrily, typing on kiwiblogh. I\u2019m afraid after the year the Police have had, they are asking for MORE powers? Sorry Greg, give me that independent police complaints authority and you can have your tasers.<br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Qy4iftwk5JM/R2FqqF_qjXI/AAAAAAAACQM/Oxpmr1NakgA/s1600-h/header04.gif"><img src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Qy4iftwk5JM/R2FqqF_qjXI/AAAAAAAACQM/Oxpmr1NakgA/s400/header04.gif" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143509520830074226" /></a>

V<p><font>\u000A</font>The official <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">Google blog</a> has a post tonight about a new project that's in closed, private beta.  The program is called Knols, or "units of knowledge."  Knols participants will write reference pages on any topic, using a Google content creation tool apparently in the works, and those pages will be highlighted in Google search results.  Authors will choose whether they want ads to appear and will receive a "substantial revenue share."\u000A</p><p>I think this is going to be a game changer.  Check out this sample page below.</p><p><center><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/thumb.png" /></center></p><p>\u000ACompeting Knols pages on the same topic will be judged by reader votes and the Google Search Quality process.  There will be reader commenting, the ability to add additional information and more social features.  It won't be a walled garden but will live on the open web.  Attribution will be substantial and Google is presumably working with high-profile topic specialists on the Knol project.\u000A</p>\u000A\u000A<p>\u000ASomewhere Jason Calacanis, his soul icy as it is, is aglow knowing that his <a href="http://mahalo.com">Mahalo</a> concept has been validated by a company that's arguably the most important in the last 100 years.  Likewise, there's probably some melancholy toasts due at <a href="http://squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> headquarters.  Those companies may or may not survive but the real battle will probably be with Wikipedia.

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/omnidrive_logo.gif" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left" />A tipster informed us today that online storage solution <a href="http://www.omnidrive.com/">Omnidrive</a> has been having technical difficulties; and that the CTO has just left the company. Omnidrive's forums, both <a href="http://forum.omnidrive.com/topic/370#post-1740">the official one</a> and <a href="http://www.tangler.com/group/omnidrive-talk">the Tangler one</a>, are filled with messages complaining that the service is up and down - messages which the company doesn't appear to be responding to. The <a href="http://www.omnidrive.com/blog/2007/08/31/all-technical-difficulties-have-been-resolved/">last post</a> on the company's blog is dated August 31st and is entitled 'All technical difficulties have been resolved!'. There's also no recent postings on CEO <a href="http://www.nik.com.au/">Nik Cubrilovic's blog</a>.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/windows_live_skydrive_launched_online_storage.php">As we wrote in August</a>, the online storage space is very crowded - and there are a few monster players in the form of Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But Omnidrive was doing some great work in the space, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/zoho_omnidrive_data_standards.php">driving for open standards</a> and partnering with other Web Office companies like Zoho.</p>\u000A<p>We've put in an email to Nik to clarify. I know him personally and it would be very sad if Omnidrive fell into the deadpool, particularly given the recent 'deaths' of Blognation and edgeio - two other web 2.0 startup collapses. As of now we're not ready to call Omnidrive as in the deadpool, but there seem to be major issues with the site judging by the forums.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/omnidrive_forum.jpg" /></p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=Ahb9FD"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=Ahb9FD" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=DJXsEfC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=DJXsEfC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=TCUpZ0C"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=TCUpZ0C" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=kQrph6c"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=kQrph6c" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=1FXOpac"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=1FXOpac" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=TT2yZgc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=TT2yZgc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=wOY2oWC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=wOY2oWC" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/200020894" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>Earlier this week we announced our <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_bigco_of_2007.php">Best BigCo of 2007</a>, Facebook. In this post we're announcing our pick for Best LittleCo. We're also asking for your nominations for Most Promising Web Company for 2008. These picks are something we do every year, this being the 4th year. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_littleco_2006.php">Last year's Best LittleCo</a> was <strong>YouTube</strong>, with <strong>Sharpcast</strong> selected as Most Promising. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_compan.php">In 2005</a><strong> 37Signals</strong> was Best LittleCo and <strong>Memeorandum</strong> (now Techmeme) and <strong>Digg</strong> were joint Most Promising. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/best_web_20_com.php">In 2004</a> <strong>Ludicorp</strong>, creators of Flickr, was Best LittleCo and <strong>Feedburner</strong> was named Most Promising. </p>\u000A<p>As you can see, most of our picks have gone on to enjoy more widespread success - YouTube, Ludicorp, Feedburner have all been acquired; while 37Signals, Techmeme, Digg and Sharpcast have all ramped up and enjoyed success. So to 2007, a year in which trends such as Mobile Web, social networking and micro-blogging have increased in popularity. It's been another bumper year of startup activity, so which among the hundreds of startups has impressed the most in 2007?</p>\u000A<h2>And the Winner is...</h2>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/twitter_logo.png" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right" />As with the BigCo selection, the Read/WriteWeb authors were unanimous in our decision. <strong>The Best LittleCo of 2007 is <a href="http://twitter.com/help/aboutus">Twitter, Inc</a>.</strong> Already this week there has been a lot of analysis about <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, with some people <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/2007/12/whats-interesting-about-twitter-isnt.cfm">embracing</a> it and others <a href="http://publishing2.com/2007/12/11/why-i-stopped-using-twitter/">critical</a>. Our own Alex Iskold summed it up well in his post entitled <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_evolution_of_personal_publ.php">The Evolution of Personal Publishing</a>, when he described Twitter as a kind of mix between social networks and chat. The term for this has come to be know as <em>microblogging</em>. Here is how Alex described it:</p>\u000A<blockquote>\u000A  <p>&quot;Social network publishing is very terse, blog publishing is verbose. Is there a form of publishing which is on one hand as easy as social networking, but as sequential as regular blogs? Twitter and Tumblr have recently emerged to define this new category of microblogging.&quot;</p>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/twitterlogo2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" />The simple idea of Twitter is to express what you are doing right now, in 140 characters or less. Admittedly Twitter is still very much a niche, geek activity. Earlier this year I witnessed a fellow Web 2.0 Expo attendee twittering on a mobile phone while walking down a busy San Francisco road with a group of us - and she tripped up and fell. Which kind of sums up Twitter for the early adopter, geek crowd: it is addictive, distracting, and not really necessary. </p>\u000A<p>However RWW did highlight some real-world uses this year - e.g. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_comes_to_twitter.php">Amazon uses it</a> to promote its products; and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/lone_remaining_burmese_blogger.php">Burmese bloggers used a similar product</a> to Twitter, a lightweight messaging service called CBox, to post very short updates from inside the country. </p>\u000A<p>Twitter is undoubtedly <strong>new and disruptive</strong>. In a year in which you can count on one hand the number of disruptive Web products (iPhone would be another), Twitter stands out as being something that has captured the imagination and become a new hybrid of chat, social networking and blogging. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>One of the most important things Twitter has done is open up an API to outside developers (this is an argument that co-founder Biz Stone <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_open_platform_advantage.php">made to us</a> in September).  According to Twitter, the API has seen such incredible growth, that just months after it was released it is already getting 10 times the traffic of the Twitter web site. For examples, check out our <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_twitter_apps.php">Top 10 Twitter Apps</a> from July; and Marshall Kirkpatrick's comprehensive <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_rww_guide_to_the_worlds_mo.php">RWW Guide to the World's Most Popular Twitter Clients</a>.</p>\u000A<p>One of Twitter's cheif rivals, <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, was <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_acquires_jaiku.php">acquired by Google</a> in October. Other similar products that impressed us this year included (but not limited to): Tumblr, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/kyte_its_like_t_1.php">Kyte</a> (a video twitter), <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/soup_tumble_blogging_with_friends.php">Soup</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pownce_send_stuff_to_friends.php">Pownce</a>, and the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/10_micro-blogging_tools_compared.php">10 microblogging tools</a> we reviewed in September.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/content-pipe.jpg" /></p>\u000A<p>See Also: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/evolution_of_communication.php">Evolution of Communication: From Email to Twitter and Beyond</a></p>\u000A<h2>Nominations? Most Promising Web Company for 2008</h2>\u000A<p>So there you have it, Twitter is our Best LittleCo this year. Now we turn our attention to what is the most promising Web product or company for 2008 - and we need your help! Let us know in the comments what is most promising for you, and why. We'll announce this very soon!</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=qvZMI6"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=qvZMI6" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=uVv0ZeC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=uVv0ZeC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=CX5x9eC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=CX5x9eC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=fX27ifc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=fX27ifc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=7D8Swnc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=7D8Swnc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=RJEIHoc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=RJEIHoc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=pzdNd5C"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=pzdNd5C" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/199946129" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><font>\u000A</font><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/flickr_jan07.jpg" align="left" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" />Users with a pro account at <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> are now able to view a variety of interesting statistics about the viewers of their photos.  Heather Champ said in a post on the <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/12/13/stats-stats-baby/">Flickr blog</a> this morning that the stats are intended to "give you all sorts of insight into how people arrive at your photos."\u000A</p><p>\u000AViewer numbers are a big deal for many Flickr users and Champ says this is one of their most requested features.  <strong>In a world increasingly full of user generated content platforms, offering users basic traffic stats like referring URLs ought to be standard practice.</strong> Offering these numbers to premium subscribers makes a lot of sense.  I expect this will be one more practice that Flickr blazes the trail on, only to be followed by others in a wide variety of markets.</p>\u000A<p>The stats feature needs to be activated by the user.  Large screenshots of the process can be found on <a href="http://blog.extraface.com/2007/12/13/flickr-stats-new-flickr-feature-on-the-way/">the blog of consultant Dave Coustan</a>, where I learned about the news myself.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?a=B2By1Z"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/readwriteweb?i=B2By1Z" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=T90GeAC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=T90GeAC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=ob6mPhC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=ob6mPhC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=xyEDJ9c"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=xyEDJ9c" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=7ee0yQc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=7ee0yQc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=u80uXCc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=u80uXCc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?a=D5PLoZC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/readwriteweb?i=D5PLoZC" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/199878931" height="1" width="1" />

VMobile MySpace On Sprint: Do Carrier Deals Make Sense?

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/myspace-logo.jpg" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" />Fox Interactive announced today that it has a deal with Sprint to offer one-click access to the new MySpace Mobile portal when it launches early next year.  Sprint and Fox have had a mobile relationship since before mobile meant much, in fact.  This could be a sneeze turned into a press release, but it's also a good opportunity to examine carrier-based mobile content deals vs. open social networking on mobile.</p>\u000A\u000A<p> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712130938DOWJONESDJONLINE000793_FORTUNE5.htm">Early press on the deal</a> says Sprint will be first but it does not say that it will be an exclusive deal.    It was around this same time last year that MySpace announced a deal with Cingular that would let that carrier's customers use a Java app for MySpace for $3 per month.  Helio, a high-profile handset that operates on the Sprint network, has allowed access to MySpace since last year as well.  This week Helio launched a mobile YouTube interface that <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/business/news/e3icf7a9c3d15e7be1ce9172be6b3938e16">the company says</a> is the first to allow YouTube users access to their accounts and social features.\u000A</p><p>\u000A<strong>The primary question this raises, though, is this:</strong>  why not just open a free, universally accessible mobile MySpace like Facebook offers?  Facebook Mobile is excellent and would provide as good a model for MySpace as the Facebook Newsfeed did for the new MySpace friend feed.  (See our coverage of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_networks_study_fabernovel.php">MySpace vs. Facebook in general</a>.) Just add some adds and superfluous pageviews and you've got MySpace Mobile. Perhaps MySpace felt it was not capable of monetizing mobile access except through carrier deals.  That would be interesting news for the rest of the industry.\u000A</p><p>\u000AMobile access could be a key step in MySpace regaining growth momentum, but that seems more likely if the company were to open mobile access to all.  It's an interesting trade-off and I wish I was a fly on the wall at the meetings where these decisions were being made.\u000A</p><h2>Tracking the Mobile Content World</h2><p>\u000AThanks to Forrester's <a href="http://web-stragist.com">Jeremiah Owyang</a>, who called attention to the news first in my world, on <a href="http://twitter.com/jowyang">Twitter</a>.

V<p>With a hat tip to a clean shaven Mike, this <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/online_accounting_google_apps.php" target="_blank">post</a> over on RWW surmises that an online accounting system might be in the pipline from Google. The rationale for the idea of Google entering this space is pretty much the rationale for them entering every space - eyeballs, data and stickiness.</p>\u000A<p>If we look however at who Google are - they are predominantly a mass market player - as such they're keen to get the maximum number of eyeballs in any one particular space.</p>\u000A<p>With that in mind, I'm picking that Google will launch a financial offering, but it'll be more along the lines of "Google your money" than "Google business money". I'm picturing home budgeting (obvious advertising fit there ) and cashflow. Some nice calculators to work stuff out and the like. All these things can be rolled out pretty globally without customisation, accounting is much more location specific and not completely within the current Google model.</p>\u000A<p>I'm sure they do have people looking at the business accounting space but I don't see it happening in the near future... but then again I could be wrong. I wonder if <a href="http://www.xero.com" target="_blank">Xero</a> feel like commenting on the possibiilty?</p>

VAs regular readers of this site will be aware I've had a lot of problems with <a href="http://www.mintshot.co.nz/">Mintshot</a> and have been in contact with them to try and resolve the issues.<br /><br />Turns out that when I said I was one of handful of people who had <a href="http://www.nzrealitytv.com/2007/12/mintshot-play-people-other-errors.html">problems with yesterday's results</a> on my Play The People bets, that I was <span>literally </span>one of a handful. According to Nick Dalton, one of the directors of Mintshot, you could count the number of people who had that precise problem on one hand.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_HZlxBZQcoGI/R08kP1x28oI/AAAAAAAABQQ/lt_0ljjVmfo/s320/mintshot+logo.gif"><img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_HZlxBZQcoGI/R08kP1x28oI/AAAAAAAABQQ/lt_0ljjVmfo/s320/mintshot+logo.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Mintshot have been extremely helpful, (not to mention relieved that it hasn't happened again this morning) and are beavering away testing their system to try to identify where the problem might have occurred. I'm not sure we'll ever get to the bottom of it, but I feel satisfied that they're taking the problem seriously and are keen to hear what users have to say about the system. I look forward to the day when I won't feel compelled to take screenshots of every bet!<br /><br />Nick tells me that Mint Tick (the game where you click to reveal ticks or crosses with the highest score winning prizes) is proving very popular, and has increased traffic to the site. I confess I've given it a go, but so far I haven't got anywhere near the number of ticks I need to win a prize.<br /><br />Also in "inside" news from Mintshot, I heard that the blog is currently in test mode and will be up on their site soon. Users will be able to check in to find out what's happening with the site and voice their concerns with interactive comments on the blog. Nick tells me that it's their intention to improve the community feel of the site with more opportunities for members to vote on what's happening. He assures me that Mintshot takes customer feedback seriously, and I believe him.<br /><br />Nick says the team are working closely with users to eliminate any cheats or shortcuts in the system that enable people to watch advertisements multiple times or find other ways to boost their points. Mintshot get daily reports of suspicious activity and act on it. That will be a relief to many, who are casting their eyes in suspicion at people who appear to have large mint dollar balances, have won lots of prizes or are doing well in the mint tick games. It's creating an atmosphere of distrust, as players accuse others of cheating and dob them in to Mintshot.<br /><br />After past problems with cheating, there is still a concern from some users that people are finding ways to cheat. If they are, I haven't heard about it, although I do know a lot of people took advantage of the problems that occurred in Monday's changeover of advertisements that enabled some people to watch advertisements multiple times. One user reported that they took advantage of the loophole and then got banned. He thought that was unfair.<br /><br />It's hard to know what's fair. On the one hand, some people wrote to Mintshot and pointed out the problem. For example, I emailed when I found that a McDonald's advertisement that I had already watched, could be watched a second time after the question changed, giving me an extra 200 mint dollars. Others say that if the system has problems, then it's fair game and they're entitled to take advantage of it. I can see both perspectives but personally I don't think it's worth it.<br /><br />Fingers crossed, this is the end of my hassles with Mintshot, and things go smoothly from now on. If not, you'll definitely be hearing from me...\u000A<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?a=6y3Apf"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/NewZealandRealityTv?i=6y3Apf" border="0" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=GO5H1zC"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=GO5H1zC" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=LhvYLZc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=LhvYLZc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=ieTQRhc"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=ieTQRhc" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?a=6jXWZ3c"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/NewZealandRealityTv?i=6jXWZ3c" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewZealandRealityTv/~4/199573753" height="1" width="1" />

Serial killers often are not the grumpy no mates types, but go out of their way to befriend everyone.</p>\u000A<p>He's just too clingy and needy.  I hope it is him anyway as his character is so annoying.</p>\u000A<p>Thursday's episode suggest it could still be Scotty. And that was one of the three leaked endings.</p>\u000A<p>The funniest twist would be if it was Yvonne!</p>\u000A<p>We'll find out soon.</p>

As America gears up for its "YouTube election," the combination of online and cellphone video is making its presence felt here too. </em></p>\u000A<p><em>The left has scrambled, but made ground quickly in these tabloid stakes. The Standard, a Labour Party mouthpiece blog, has uploaded sly video footage of John Key sniffing vegetables in an unwieldy fashion at a market - the left-wing sequel to the Exclusive Brethren's tasteless rubbish-rummaging of minister's last year. The Standard also led the "John Key illegal downloads" story. </em></p>\u000A<p><em>On the right, the National Party's David Farrar made the early running online with careful analytical posts; Farrar's talent is summarising complex issues for journalists simply but comprehensively, but not so much so that readers could come to a different conclusion to him.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>It's a pity I can't post the whole column - it's very good.</p>

V<p>National announced last night that it has decided to reopen nominations for Selwyn, after <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4323181a19720.html">complaints of pressure</a> on some candidates not to stand.</p>\u000A<p>This is not a common occurrence.  I don't think I can recall another selection where this has happened.</p>\u000A<p>I know absolutely nothing about the details, beyond what I have read in the newspaper.   But what I can say is what my personal view is.</p>\u000A<p>I think every seat not currently held by National should have an active selection contest.  Yes it can be challenging for managing parliamentary relationships, but overall the party gains members and supporters when we have contested selections for seats National does not hold.</p>\u000A<p>Another reason I support contested selections, is that on current polling National could gain 55 - 60 MPs.  And with a policy that all but a maximum of five list candidates must also be electorate candidates, it means that even candidates in the most safe Labour seats have a significant chance of becoming MPs through the list.  And a healthy selection process can help ensure that National doesn't end up with "dud" MPs as happened in 1990.</p>\u000A<p>National of course also has a history of selection battles for sitting electorate MPs - John Key, Judith Collins and John Carter all won their seats by challenging for the nomination against an incumbent electorate MP.  And National is far better off for having had them do so.</p>\u000A<p>The issue of List MPs is a bit different.  A List MP doesn't hold a seat, even though they may have stood for it last time or be associated with it.  There isn't the same stigma to stand against a List MP for a seat, as there is to actually challenge an Electorate MP.  For example Annabel Young faced a contested selection for Wellington Central despite being an existing List MP.</p>\u000A<p>So National has a good healthy history of contested selections, and it is good to see the same will happen in Selwyn - safe seats especially should have a vigorous contest.</p>

V<p>Some commenters on the left are always going on about the important of disclosure, and go into a fury if a Richard Long column (for example) doesn't appear with a disclaimer that he used to work for Don Brash (as indeed did I).</p>\u000A<p>And I noticed yesterday The Standard also finally managed to <a href="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/?p=859#comment-9812">find a column</a> in a newspaper in favour of the Electoral Finance Bill.</p>\u000A<p>It is written by Simon Cunliffe, a senior ODT journalist.</p>\u000A<p>Strangely though, they did not think it necessary to mention that Mr Cunliffe was just two months ago a press secretary to a Labour Minister.</p>\u000A<p>Now I don't think this in anyway diminishes the legitimacy of Simon Cunliffe's opinion.  He has every right to write his honest opinion of the Electoral Finance Bill.</p>\u000A<p>I just thought there was a double standard for those insisting every Richard Long column mention his previous job (which now was over two years ago) and not applying the same standard to someone who had a political role much more recently.</p>

The <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10482229">Herald editorial</a> is blunt:</p>\u000A<p>The Starship children's hospital should immediately return the cheque it has received from the New Zealand First Party. This money is public property.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Mr Peters has not technically broken the law but only because he has used his party's votes in Parliament to help legalise the spending at the last election that the Auditor-General believes to be wrong. He has always disagreed with the Auditor-General's ruling and had wanted to contest it in the courts. But he has dropped this action, he says, because he could not have gotten a decision before the election next year and did not want to face the election accused of refusing to pay back "stolen money".</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>This claim that they could not have got a hearing in time is one media should treat with suspicion.  The Auditor-General ruled in the latter half of 2006.  I have not seen anything to suggest that one could not have got a court hearing within two years.  For example the lawsuit against the Electoral Finance Bill only has a six month wait for a hearing.</p>\u000A<p>The other point to remember is that there was a lawsuit which would have tested whether the Auditor-General was correct.  Darnton vs Clark.  With regards to the Labour pledge card at least, this would have resulted in a court ruling whether or not the expenditure was legal.</p>\u000A<p>NZ First voted to kill off the lawsuit, voting against an amendment that would have stopped the validating legislation retrospectively killing off the lawsuit.</p>

There was an article in yesterday's <span>Dominion Post</span> (not online), and a <a href="http://wellington.govt.nz/news/display-item.php?id=3090">media release from the council</a>, stating that a demolition consent has been applied for for the proposed supermarket site that has been <a href="http://wellurban.blogspot.com/2007/08/mt-cook-summit.html">much discussed</a>. While both articles are primarily concerned about the possibility of the site being left vacant for months, there's a small point mentioned in the Dom article that's quite interesting: the proposal has been scaled down somewhat.<br /><br />Instead of a 6000 sq m <span>Pak 'N Save</span> with 60 apartments, <span>Foodstuffs</span> are now proposing "a medium-sized <span>New World</span> supermarket above a car park with space for 157 vehicles, and a couple of four to five-storey blocks, each with 20 apartments". The façade of <a href="http://mtcookmobilised.pbwiki.com/Preserving+heritage+values+-+the+BGI">the old BGI swimming pool</a> will also be retained and incorporated, and while I'm always wary of façadism, this all sounds like some sort of compromise is happening quietly during the pre-application stage of the consent process. If the actual consent process (which <span>Foodstuffs</span> expects to start in March) were able to ensure that the final design incorporates plenty of active edges and maybe even a replacement for the pool, then I think we could go a long way towards balancing the needs of what could be a valuable development with the legitimate concerns of current residents. Fingers crossed.

Interestingly, the announcement includes a perspective drawing that makes it much easier to grasp the overall layout than the entry itself did.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Y5J8pfNiQA4/R2G31fVLcLI/AAAAAAAAAk4/ZOFUa4uhijw/s1600-h/frank_kitts_proposed_perspective.jpg"><img src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Y5J8pfNiQA4/R2G31fVLcLI/AAAAAAAAAk4/ZOFUa4uhijw/s400/frank_kitts_proposed_perspective.jpg" border="0" alt="Winning design for Frank Kitts Park" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143594379005096114" /></a>In my <a href="http://wellurban.blogspot.com/2007/11/last-chance-feedback.html">summary of the options</a>, I said of this one that it has "Nice clean geometry, with a good tight cluster of buildings, but too much bleakly flat lawn." I think I still stand by that, but that's partly based on my own personal aversion to big open paddocks, and people who want a big flat space for chucking around a ball or frisbee should be very pleased with this. In fact, for all the talk in some quarters of the redesign "destroying open space", it looks like this plan actually has more open green space than the current park:<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Y5J8pfNiQA4/R2GsMPVLcKI/AAAAAAAAAkw/tcVOK3NHVqc/s1600-h/frank_kitts_old_vs_proposed.jpg"><img src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Y5J8pfNiQA4/R2GsMPVLcKI/AAAAAAAAAkw/tcVOK3NHVqc/s400/frank_kitts_old_vs_proposed.jpg" alt="Current Frank Kitts Park layout compared to selected new design" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143581575707586722" border="0" /></a>The most important thing is to compare the new design to the current park. On the plus side, this will finally be a waterfront park from which you can actually see the water. It will be an opportunity to update the physical and design qualities of a park that is looking rather tired and dated. The Chinese Garden, which I think is handled better than in any of the rival designs, should provide a lot of spatial variety, visual interest, shelter and cultural value. The upper lawn will have better access from the promenade and lagoon, and in general movement into and through the park should be easier. Best of all, from my perspective, the cluster of pavilions in and adjacent to the Chinese Garden has the potential to create a node of activity part way along a stretch that can be quite deserted at times.<br /><br />Apart from the exposed nature of the lawn space, there are a few other aspects I'm less happy with. I don't see the need to relocate the Albatross sculpture to the upper lawn: it's very popular where it is, and the current combination of lagoon, fountain and <span>Kaffee Eis</span> works very well. The larger flat green area comes at the expense of the amphitheatre, so while it will be better for some sorts of events it will be less suited to others. There's no attempt to create new connections between the promenade and the water, though the brief suggested that this might be left until later stages for financial reasons. Finally, the improved visual connection between the lawn and the harbour comes at the expense of shelter and seating along the promenade: while the loss of shelter may be an unavoidable trade-off, I hope that some sort of informal or moveable seating could be included without too much effort.<br /><br />The article emphasised that this is not a final, detailed design, and that more development of the design will occur over the next six months. There's a lot to like about this proposal, and I hope that between now and the eventual reconstruction of the park (which is unlikely to start before 2009), there are opportunities to work through any shortcomings and create the best possible space.

This money is public&nbsp;property.</p>\u000A<p>Winston Peters has given the $158,000 due the taxpayer to a charity of his choosing. If any other taxpayer did this the Inland Revenue would pursue him for the&nbsp;debt.</p>\u000A<p>Mr Peters has not technically broken the law but only because he has used his party's votes in Parliament to help legalise the spending at the last election that the Auditor-General believes to be wrong. He has always disagreed with the Auditor-General's ruling and had wanted to contest it in the courts. But he has dropped this action, he says, because he could not have gotten a decision before the election next year and did not want to face the election accused of refusing to pay back "stolen&nbsp;money".</p>\u000A<p>So he has given it to the Starship. It is extraordinary that the hospital has accepted the money in these circumstances. It perhaps has not given enough thought to the&nbsp;implications.</p>\u000A<p>Advertisement<br />&nbsp;Advertisement</p>\u000A<p>It is letting itself be used for a petty political purpose. Mr Peters is using public sympathy for sick children to avoid a payment he believes his party should not have to make. Rather than accept the ruling against him and return the money to the public purse he has put the amount in a place he calculates to be beyond public&nbsp;reproach.</p>\u000A<p>The Starship is being cynically used and must know it. The hospital is part of the public health service. By accepting a donation that properly belongs to the public revenue it is complicit in an act of political manipulation and potentially depriving parts of the health service that may be less well endowed of&nbsp;funds.</p>\u000A<p>If the hospital means to keep this money it is obliged to explain to taxpayers why it believes the <span class="caps">NZ</span> First Party was entitled to dispose of the misspent election funds as it wished. This is not a political-legal dispute a public hospital would be wise to enter. The Starship would be well advised to return the cheque or, even better, pay it into the public accounts where it&nbsp;belongs.</p>\u000A<p>As for Mr Peters, the public doesn't seem surprised. Stunts of transparent nonsense have long been his preferred mode of operation. Most people have ceased to take him too seriously. He is excused for impish behaviour that would not be accepted from anyone else in public&nbsp;office.</p>\u000A<p>Seldom, though, has he displayed such contempt for public opinion and public finance as he has on this occasion. He freely admitted yesterday that the misuse of party allowances at the 2005 election was an issue "on which the court of public opinion had already made its final&nbsp;ruling".</p>\u000A<p>Since his party could not get a contrary declaration from the courts before the end of next year, he said, it proceeded to raise the amount the Auditor-General ruled that it owed but it was not willing to see the money disappear into the Government coffers.</div></p>\u000A<p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/" rel="nofollow">ScribeFire</a>.</p>

A few throwaway remarks by Helen Clark have got her into trouble with parts of the press gallery - notably the political editors of TV1 and TV3, Guyon Espiner and Duncan Garner.</p>\u000A<p>As is so often the case, it's not what the Prime Minister originally said but what has happened since that is so interesting. </p>\u000A<p>The Prime Minister, who values her relationship with the gallery and has always gone to some lengths to preserve it - now wants to move on. But I'd like a transcript, or better still, a tape of her address to the journalists. Her office has one, but it won't release it. </p>\u000A<p>I know what you're thinking - why wasn't I there? Well, just to get this clear, because the Prime Minister's office thinks this is important, <em>I didn't attend her speech</em>. There has been some comment that this is an important factor - even that it means I don't have the right to blog on the topic. For the record, I would have liked to go but a) I was at home in bed sick and b) I didn't know about it anyway.</p>\u000A<p>Only one press gallery reporter attended. No one has a tape. Most didn't know about the Prime Minister's appearance either. We have been criticised for this. The Prime Minister's office points out that the engagement was in the ministerial diary forwarded to the press gallery each week. That's true. But no advisory was sent out, which is unusual. Normally we are encouraged to attend her speeches, although obviously we can't always do so.</p>\u000A<p>Anyway, now that's clear, I am relying on what was reported by <em>New Zealand Herald</em> journalist Claire Trevett, who did attend, and wrote a story which to the best of my knowledge Clark has not taken issue with. So what follows is based on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=49&amp;objectid=10481591"><strong>what Claire wrote </strong></a>and also speaking to others who were there. </p>\u000A<p>In her presentation to the conference, Clark said many journalists were young, and while this meant that they had "energy and a fresh perspective", most of them had major gaps in their general knowledge.</p>\u000A<p>Clark said "very few" journalists had a comprehensive knowledge of New Zealand's international relations and few media outlets sent journalists to cover her international trips.</p>\u000A<p>"It's a matter of regret that proprietors don't seem to think these things are particularly important either, so they don't encourage the depth of coverage."</p>\u000A<p>She also said media also needed to consider blogging by senior political reporters on the websites of major news outlets. </p>\u000A<p>"Of course, if you commit yourself to instant opinion, then when it comes time to putting in a considered piece, you might think, 'Whoops, that was a rush of judgment,' but it becomes hard to climb back from."</p>\u000A<p>Clark only mentioned one journalist by name, Duncan Garner, who she said was an example of a journalist too willing to confuse scutiny with cynicism, and who recently claimed that all politicians lied.</p>\u000A<p>Garner tells me this was a poor paraphrase of a remark he made recently to a journalism industry event, at which he said, referring to the Benson-Pope saga, that when cornered, a politician's first instinct was to lie.  </p>\u000A<p>I can think of a few MPs this applies to, although Clark has every right to say these things, and they are food for thought. Worthy of debate. I'm intrigued, then, as to why her office won't release the rest of what she said so I can post it here for everyone to read or listen to.</p>\u000A<p>One could draw the conclusion that it is because the Prime Minister realises she went too far in some of her remarks and unfairly denigrated some senior journalists. That she wants the issue closed, because attacking the Fourth Estate is never very productive for a politician. And perhaps, there is more on the tape she'd prefer didn't get reported.</p>\u000A<p>I could be completely wrong. I'm just saying one could come to that conclusion, given the PM's office's peculiar refusal to release the tape.</p>\u000A<p>As regular On the House readers will know, the PM's press secretary Juli Clausen posted an entry for the first time the other day, criticising me for not attending the speech and also making errors in my earlier post. I'm grateful for her post. According to her office the PM didn't actually use the words "too young to remember history", and if that's the case they should not have been in speech marks.</p>\u000A<p>I was unhappy about clarifying this without a transcript of what Clark actually said, which as I said has proven elusive. The PM's office has since dropped its request for a correction, but I've been trying to find out what she did say anyway.</p>\u000A<p>This little media storm in a teacup has been picked up by <em>Media Watch</em>, Radio New Zealand's weekly look at the media, which has interviewed both Clark and Garner. Amongst the remarks the PM makes on the programme are that news organisations don't appear willing to pay the salaries necessary to retain the sorts of senior journalists one would expect to be in high-ranking news jobs in New Zealand.</p>\u000A<p>But Clark denies this is the same thing as saying those who are doing the jobs in New Zealand are too young for their positions. </p>\u000A<p>To my knowledge it's the first time the PM has appeared on <em>Media Watch</em>, and it would be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/nr/programmes/mediawatch"><strong>worth a listen </strong></a>(Sunday 9am and 10pm on RNZ and posted on their website).</p>

V<p>Times could be about to get tougher for England's dismal band of underachieving footballers. If there's one thing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4323930a18075.html"><strong>Fabio Capello</strong> </a>believes in, it's the value of hard work. Just ask Ronaldo, Alessandro del Piero and Francesco Totti, who have all found themselves dropped by Capello for daring not to work hard enough.</p>\u000A<p>When Capello left Juventus, del Piero is reported to have said: "Now I can return to playing football with the love I have for it. The era of terror in training has now gone." Ruud van Nistelrooy said he has never worked as hard as he did under Capello at Real Madrid.</p>\u000A<p>The good news for England is that the common factor here is not the whining of highly paid prima donnas: it's that Juventus and Madrid - and Totti's Roma - won things during those days of supposedly forced labour. If Peter Crouch ends up even skinnier but with a World Cup winners' medal round his neck, I for one won't be complaining.</p>\u000A<p>His critics - including some on this site - have pointed out that Capello's teams don't always play what Ruud Gullit would call \u201Csheckshy futbol\u201D. But they certainly play winning football, and right now most England fans would find that pretty sexy. His great strength for the England job is not so much his impeccable record as his frequently proven ability to confront players who aren't performing.</p>\u000A<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren both seemed to believe that it was enough to pick the best players and let them take it from there. But footballers are simple souls and, just like the rest of us, respond to good management. Of course the players must take their share of the blame for England's poor recent performances, but if they're not playing well it's up to their manager to change things.</p>\u000A<p>Capello himself has said recently: "How can players of the level of Beckham or Owen have performances so different when they play for their national team? It's clear the shirt is very heavy even for those great champions. The manager has a fundamental role to play in this situation. He has to be more of a psychologist than a tactician or a technician.\u201D</p>\u000A<p>And maybe sometimes he needs to be just plain scary. Something has to be done to translate the club form of England's leading players to the international arena, and if that something turns out to be sheer hard work, then make 'em sweat, Fabio.</p>

Or (especially as here, where the employee is key to the business), regard the worker as innocent unless and until proven otherwise - and allow them to work on in their job?</p>\u000A<p>Well, in this case I can now offer an update - and tell you about the outcome of this horrible story.</p>\u000A<p>The league suspended Vick from playing - so even if the employer had other ideas, he couldn't play this season (at least while charged).</p>\u000A<p>Vick's team - the Atlanta Falcons - have won only three of their 13 games, and are at the bottom of their division (an outcome which has an undoubted financial consequence for the employer).</p>\u000A<p>Vick has been found guilty of running a dogfighting operation and <a target="_blank" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3148549"><strong>was this week sentenced to (wait for it) 23 months in jail</strong></a>. Even with things going his way he won't be back to play football next season - and possibly also the season after.</p>\u000A<p>What counted against him (among other things) was the fact that he initially lied about his involvement - and then tested positive for marijuana use in violation of the terms set for his release.</p>\u000A<p>He has been stripped of a $20 million bonus, will lose about $50 million in endorsements, and $71 million in annual salary (for each year that he will be away from the game).</p>\u000A<p>It is perhaps no surprise that Vick has - according to his lawyer - now been diagnosed as clinically depressed.</p>\u000A<p>Wow. How a mistake in life can cost you your career...and more.</p>\u000A<p>But is there anybody who thinks this penalty unfair?</p>\u000A<p><em>Picture: REUTERS</em></p>

I hear you intone into your keyboard: ". . .mmmmwhat about Oprah?"</p>\u000A<p>Yes OK, Oprah is no size 10. But Oprah is in a different category because she is so very, very smart.</p>\u000A<p>If Britney didn't look like such an ordinary, normal, frumpy person, if she was as svelte as Paris, and as cool as Mary Kate, sure she'd get dissed for being a lousy mum but she wouldn't face scorn like she is now.<br />\u000AIt's horrible but it's true.

I feel really sorry for Mrs B. No matter what she does, she gets slammed. It must be frightening picking up the paper because the spin that's put on things is wild. Just recently the reformed Spice Girls appeared for Victoria's Secret with Baby in a dress Britney had worn in 2002 and Geri in a dress Britney had worn in 2004. The girls are dressed by a stylist who would almost definitely have gotten the sack for this "embarrassment" but somehow poor old Mrs B got the blame for having supposedly evilly orchestrated the (ultimately 'who-gives-a-****' ) situation.</p>\u000A<p>I am convinced that:</p>\u000A<p>* If she had nice fake bosoms like everyone else instead of upturned cupcakes on her chest, and . . .</p>\u000A<p>* If she had long hair instead of short hair and</p>\u000A<p>* If she had a smile instead of a stare (she hates her teeth)</p>\u000A<p>she would be loved and lauded. . . .</p>\u000A<p>And she would never have been blamed for that stylist stuff up.</p>\u000A<p>Hell of a shallow world isn't it!</p>\u000A<p><em>(Photos by Reuters)</em></p>

I look forward to getting all the way through the set of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=80325"><strong>AC/DC live clips</strong></a> \u2013 and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0965382/"><strong>Tom Petty documentary</strong></a>. But for every nostalgia trip (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominionpost/blogs/blogonthetracks/2007/11/28/plugging-back-in-to-nirvana/"><strong>see this polarising post</strong></a>) there are excursions in to the bland world of \u201Cwhy was I sent this?\u201D</p>\u000A<p>Music DVDs are great for me to review on the <a target="_blank" href="http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/430905/599116"><strong><em>Good Morning</em> TV show</strong></a>; it means I have a ready-made clip without having to beg for beta footage. We can just use the visuals from the disc. Good stuff. But some of the DVDs that arrive just baffle me. I sit through them all though. I am a professional.</p>\u000A<p>So, I thought I\u2019d whip through a few quickly \u2013 ones that I may not get to review elsewhere. Some of these are not (to me) so flash. You might love them. Let\u2019s have a peek\u2026</p>\u000A<p>From the ongoing <em>Live From Austin TX </em>series I sat down to watch the recent offerings (old gigs, but recently released on DVD) from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/John-Mayall-Live-Austin-Texas/dp/B000V6BE1M"><strong>John Mayall</strong></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polyphonic-Spree-Live-Austin-Texas/dp/B000UDLA4M"><strong>The Polyphonic Spree</strong></a>. Both of these discs are pretty cool. But the gig (in each case) is a mere 50 minutes. With no extras. So \u2013 if John Mayall and/or The Polyphonic Spree are among your favourite artists then you will want these DVDs. The Spree sprawl across the stage, their sweetly manufactured harmonies and hippy-dippy costumes are either to your taste or not. But I rather enjoyed watching this set. I think they\u2019d be cool to see live. John Mayall looks ridiculous in this gig from 1993. He looks like the embarrassing uncle at any 21st. But it\u2019s a reasonably decent blues-rock set.</p>\u000A<p>I have never understood <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nellyfurtado.com/"><strong>Nelly Furtado\u2019s </strong></a>appeal. Watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ilikemusic.co.uk/pop/Nelly_Furtado_Do_It_Loose_Concert_DVD-4285"><em><strong>Loose \u2013 The Concert </strong></em></a>didn\u2019t help at all. I hated that song <em>I\u2019m Like a Bird</em>. And when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/minisites/nickhornby/index.html"><strong>Nick Hornby</strong></a> tried to write in praise of it (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/31-Songs-Nick-Hornby/dp/0141013400"><em><strong>31 Songs</strong></em></a>) it made me hate Nick Hornby. Here Furtado, who has had a big year, and basically made herself over as a pop star (again), comes across as <strong>Gloria Estefan </strong>before the crash (in all senses of the word). I wish the rhythm really would get her.</p>\u000A<p><img vspace="5" align="right" src="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/elvis_1970-275-x-424.jpg" hspace="5" alt="elvis_1970-275-x-424.jpg" title="elvis_1970-275-x-424.jpg" /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.elvis.com/"><strong>Elvis Presley </strong></a>is pretty cool. It is easy to say that he was not a good musician, but that\u2019s missing the point. Big time. Elvis really was the greatest \u2013 at what he did. He rocked. It took me years to really get my head around how superb he was \u2013 at his best \u2013 but I\u2019m there now and one of my favourite music DVDs is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065687/"><em><strong>Elvis \u2013 That\u2019s The Way It Is.</strong></em></a> Yes, I know that every year some record company folk decide there must be a way to repackage and re-sell The King. And it seems to (usually) work. This year there was another greatest hits CD. And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/dvd/elvis_the_king_dvd_19.shtml"><em><strong>Elvis: The King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll</strong></em></a> is the accompanying DVD. I rather enjoyed this \u2013 to me it was a bit of a one-watch though. Thirty songs are shown, from early promo clips through to the classic <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley's_'68_Comeback_Special"><em><strong>\u201968 Comeback Special</strong></em></a> and my aforementioned favourite show/film (from 1970). If you never liked Elvis I guess it is obvious that you should pray that no one gives you this DVD for Christmas. If you know someone who likes Elvis (and statistics suggest that is most definitely the case) then you could do worse than offer this sampler-DVD to the one you love who loves Elvis Presley.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/s/1025694_keane_live_dvd_universal"><em><strong>Keane Live</strong></em></a> was next in the DVD player. Not keen.</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidbowie.com/"><strong>David Bowie</strong></a> has had a remarkable career \u2013 but two words tend to put fear in the heart of even the most ardent support of the erstwhile Ziggy, the former Thin White Duke. And no, I don\u2019t mean <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Machine"><strong>Tin Machine</strong></a>. I mean two <em>other</em> words. <em>Glass Spider</em>. Finally the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dvdmg.com/davidbowieglassspider.shtml"><strong>1987 tour comes to DVD </strong></a>(what, there was actually demand for this?). I remember watching the video and not understanding it at all. It is almost hilariously kitsch to watch this show now, 20 years on. What has he thinking? The dancers look like they were modelled on extras from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/"><em><strong>The Warriors</strong></em></a> \u2013 all this from a guy deemed cutting edge? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/"><em><strong>Labyrinth</strong></em></a> must have rotted his brain. When <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Frampton"><strong>Peter Frampton</strong></a> is playing guitar on stage \u2013 and it is not the worst thing happening\u2026well, it is time to look elsewhere for answers, right? But, if, like me, you are a bit of Bowie fan, you might still like a look at this. Just don\u2019t look too closely. One watch should be the rule here.</p>\u000A<p>This year I had the displeasure to hear an album called <em>Life in Cartoon Motion</em> by some berk named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mikasounds.com/uk.php"><strong>Mika</strong></a>. This guy seems keen to try to take the worst elements of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scissorsisters.com/intro/"><strong>The Scissor Sisters </strong></a>and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness"><strong>The Darkness </strong></a>and prove that he can make something even worse! No-Brainer, right? Instead of being a post-millennial <strong>Bee Gees</strong> and/or a post-millennial <strong>Meatloaf</strong>, Mika has desires to be the new <strong>Freddy Mercury</strong>. This is so blatantly obvious that in the interview segments on the DVD I am about to mention he talks about how he is not just a one-man <strong>Queen</strong> revival. Which pretty much guarantees you that he is in fact a one-man Queen revival \u2013 so, we get to the DVD: <strong><em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mika-Live-Cartoon-Motion/dp/B000WOYRJE">Live in Cartoon Motion</a></em></strong> is Mika live in concert playing the hits from his album. It is really horrible. He also covers <strong>The Eurhythmics\u2019 </strong><em>Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) </em>and manages to make detractors forget about <strong>Marilyn Manson\u2019s </strong>decimation of <em>Sweet Dreams</em>. The painful falsetto prancing over cheap ivory-tinkling is a gimmick that is swiftly worn out. I wouldn\u2019t send this DVD to my worst enemy for Christmas (it would be pointless anyway, sending Mika a copy of his own DVD, right?).</p>\u000A<p>Next up I watched the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7519686"><em><strong>Concert For Diana </strong></em></a>\u2013 a 2-DVD set chronicling the concert that Princes Harry and William put on for their deceased mother (\u201Cthe people\u2019s princess\u201D). There are some okay songs/performances here \u2013 but it is a long haul. A hard workout \u2013 thank god for the skip button or I never would have made it. At least five hours of performances were economically skipped down to about 35 minutes of highlights in my swift viewing. <strong>Duran Duran </strong>shows no feeling for the situation at all by singing <em>Wild Boys</em>. I thought they were going to sing <em>Hungry Like a Wolf </em>and then dedicate it to the rabid paparazzi at the scene of the crash. What, too soon? Ten years on? Of course <strong>Elton John </strong>kicked things off and he played <em>Your Song</em>. Like a total cheese.</p>\u000A<p>Then there were pointless songs by <a target="_blank" href="http://fergie.blackeyedpeas.com/"><strong>Fergie</strong></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lilyallenmusic.com/"><strong>Lily Allen</strong></a>, Nelly Furtado (ugh, I had to watch her on DVD twice in one weekend!) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anastacia.com/"><strong>Anastacia</strong></a>. Some of the old heads came through. <strong>Rod Stewart </strong>was great, launching into <em>Maggie May</em> straight away and following it up with <em>Baby Jane</em>. <strong>Bryan Ferry </strong>was all class \u2013 as he almost always is. Then the rot really set in with a ridiculous medley of ridiculous songs from the ridiculous pen of the rather, erm, ridiculous <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/html/index.htm"><strong>Andrew Lloyd-Webber</strong></a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thebubbleburst.co.uk/bb.php?entry=Jason%20Donovan"><strong>Jason Donovan</strong></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.donny.com/announcements.pl?cmd=view&amp;aid=235"><strong>Donny Osmond </strong></a>battled it out to prove who was the bigger has-been in their duelling renditions of songs from <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em>. Any dream indeed! They\u2019re both still hanging on\u2026</p>\u000A<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.diddy.com/"><strong>P Diddy </strong></a>tried to remain relevant \u2013 pointless considering <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West"><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> was there to usurp him (again). And there was a good comedy-spot by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rickygervais.com/"><strong>Ricky Gervais </strong></a>singing that song <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JitDWQI9qc"><strong>that David Brent does in the episode of <em>The Office</em> when he sabotages the team-training session</strong></a>. Gold.</p>\u000A<p>But what a long-winded DVD to sit through; boring tributes to Diana\u2019s amazing humanity ring out while roadies nearly as old as the members of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.statusquo.co.uk/"><strong>Status Quo </strong></a>plod along behind amps. Here\u2019s a newsflash: <strong>Princess Anne</strong> has done twice as much for humanitarian causes \u2013 and she\u2019s competed at the Olympic Games! (A royal doing some real work for once.) Just because she happens to look more like the horse she rides than any human should, she seems to be written off. Sad.</p>\u000A<p>I was sent a DVD by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Rieu"><strong>Andre Rieu</strong></a>. This guy is someone I have avoided for years. I have happily sold his material when I worked in music stores. I have been sent copies of his CDs and always passed them on without a listen. But a DVD? This piqued my curiosity. I wish it hadn\u2019t. I next watched <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moviestars.co.nz/DVDs/1551177.html"><em><strong>Andre Rieu in Wonderland</strong></em></a>. Oh my! This guy is a nut. A total cheese \u2013 with a smug look as he saws away rather mundanely at his violin while all around him it is as if Dorothy has gone missing and the rest of the cast of the original <em>Wizard of Oz</em> have been dug up, fed ecstasy pills and been forced to trudge through all their worst moments, being told to make it count this time! It\u2019s music/muzak for people with no clue. I wish I had the minutes of my life back between pressing play and pressing eject (and that is only about 13 minutes in total).</p>\u000A<p>As with the <em>Live from Austin TX</em> series, another ongoing set of DVDs that I like to keep in vague touch with is the <em>Live At Montreux </em>concerts. The Montreux Jazz Festival often has very little to do with actual jazz, spreading out to take in funk, soul and pop artists. Recently I received <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gpstore.co.nz/DVDs/1551714.html"><strong>the Jamiroquai entry</strong></a> \u2013 a live set from 2003\u2019s festival. I had always thought that Jamiroquai would be a great live act \u2013 I\u2019ve never been a fan of the band, but I\u2019ve never exactly hated them. I started off enjoying this concert, but was bored very swiftly. The first two Jamiroquai albums were not too bad \u2013 certainly better than anything <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> was doing at the time (which is essentially what the JK albums were, unaccredited Stevie Wonder attempts). But I guess the problem was the band continued to release those same two albums every two years for over a decade. This gig is not bad \u2013 but it drags on a little toward the end.</p>\u000A<p>From 2005, in the same series, I also watched <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.mtv.com/Isaac-Hayes--Live-at-Montreux-2005-Concerts--nf-_stcVVproductId21227982VVcatId421318VVviewprod.htm"><strong>the Isaac Hayes gig</strong></a>. This is pretty cool. It takes a while for Mr <em>Chocolate Salty Balls</em> to really wind up \u2013 starting the gig with some pretty boring material. But then the Bacharach and Jimmy Webb covers kick in \u2013 and of course the <em>Theme from Shaft</em>. And it\u2019s a rocking-sweet soul-funk affair. A good way to end \u2013 proof that not all was wasted looking through these DVDs.</p>\u000A<p>I am so thrilled that DVD players come with skip buttons, or I never would have made it.</p>\u000A<p>That\u2019s the latest batch that made it through the letterbox. There are more sitting in piles. I will get to them soon.</p>

V<p>Great to see Lee Nelson advance to day two at the APPT finale in Sydney yesterday.</p>\u000A<p>However, Waikato's James Honeybone went to the rail early on day 1b on a day of some spectacular hands at the PokerStars-sponsored tournament.</p>\u000A<p>Lee ended the day with $93,500 in chips - good enough for 25th spot among the 72 players remaining after two days, with day 1c on the cards today.</p>\u000A<p>Among the chip leaders, baby, was his fellow Team PokerStars member Scotty Nguyen with $250,400.<br />\u000ALee was all in with the remainder of his chips yesterday with Qd-Qh against Julian Powell, who made the call with As-Qs.</p>\u000A<p>That made the Kiwi a 65% fave and the board of Js-9c-8c 6h 4d meant that held up.</p>\u000A<p>Soon after doubling up, Lee picked up another big pot when he moved with Ad-Qs on a queen-high flop. His opponent tabled Ks-Qc and the 2006 Aussie Millions winner was off and running.<br />\u000A <br />\u000AJames perished when he entered a battle of the blinds with Kenny Ng.</p>\u000A<p>Ng raised from the BB to $1000 and James called to see an intriguing flop of Ad-Kh-Qs.</p>\u000A<p>James checked, Ng fbet $1200 and James made the call. The turn was the 4s and Ng fired again, this time for $5000 and James again flat-called.</p>\u000A<p>The river fell 10s and James pushed all in for his remaining $10,000. Ng made the crying call and when James revealed Kd-8s, Ng's set was good for the big pot.</p>\u000A<p>So for knocking out Waikato's finest, and for committing a monster crime against humanity for being seen at the table with a Manchester United cap on, Ng is in danger of surpassing Shawn Sheikahn at the bottom of the CROPPs.</p>\u000A<p>Both Lee and James were interviewed early in the day - the clips are on the page <a href="http://www.pokernews.com/live-reporting/video-gallery/" title="video">here</a>.</p>\u000A<p>There were a number of exciting hands played out yesterday.</p>\u000A<p>Aussie Billy Sukkar, a cousin of Joe and Tony Hachem who featured at the Aussie Millions won by Nelson, had his aces cracked by 7d-3d and sent to the rail.</p>\u000A<p>After two players limped into the pot, one from the small blind, Sukkar made it $900 to go from the big blind and got two callers.</p>\u000A<p>The flop came Qd-8d-6d and both the small blind and Sukkar checked to the initial limper, who led out with $3000. The small blind got out of the way and Sukkar called.</p>\u000A<p>The turn brought the As, giving Sukkar the top set, and he checked to his opponent who moved all in, having Sukkar covered.</p>\u000A<p>Sukkar called and his opponent revealed his made flush and the 2s on the river didn't help the young Aussie who left the tourney with a set of aces.</p>\u000A<p>The following was a personal highlight that I'm sure all home game players will love - we call it "A Short Smack moment".</p>\u000A<p>In a multi-way raised pot, a short-stack came over the top and pushed the rest of his stack in pre-flop. It was folded around quickly to an unknown internet qualifier who appeared to be giving the decision much deliberation.</p>\u000A<p>The player was not aware that the previous players had already folded and didn't realize the action was on him. After close to five minutes of apparent deep thought, the dealer called a tournament director over and called "time" on the player, giving him 60 seconds to act on his hand. The internet qualifier suddenly realised that "time" was being called on himself and apologetically threw his card into the muck.</p>\u000A<p>That's just too funny... I can just picture the net noob sitting there thinking "Man, no wonder I play on the net, these dudes take yonks!"<br />\u000A </p>\u000A<p>Van Marcus rode a mid-day rollercoaster when he had pocket Qs cracked by two players who made runner-runner straights.</p>\u000A<p>The very next hand Marcus raised from the small blind and was not surprisingly adjudged by most at the table to be nearing full tilt.</p>\u000A<p>The Aussie fired three barrels on a board of 8s-7s-3d Kh 4s and got action from one other player, who mucked when Marcus flipped over pocket aces.</p>\u000A<p>Later in the day, an uknown player with pocket rockets hit a flop of As-5s-10c when up against the pocket queens of Sol Bergren.</p>\u000A<p>But he became the second "Sukkar" to leave with a set of aces when the turn fell Kh and the river was a Jc.</p>\u000A<p>In another highlighted hand, Francisicus Dekkers was all in pre-flop with 6h6s against AsQc, makig him a slight fave (54% v 45%).</p>\u000A<p>The flop of Jh-8s-10s basically switched those numbers around and when a Js came on the turn, Dekkers' rival had a mahoosive pile of outs.</p>\u000A<p>Aussie pro Mark Vos reckoned Dekkers' opponent had an amazing 25 outs heading into the river but Dekkers escaped a bullet on the river for his sixes to hold.</p>\u000A<p>Last night's home game saw a reduced field as a number of the usual suspects chose other pursuits.</p>\u000A<p>Monty, aka The Big Unit, has a black mark against his name and will never win a major if he doesn't bring his clubs. The Mentor also chose intoxication instead of mixing it with poker like he normally does while Poochie continued his Lord Lucan impersonation and Short Smack was doing his own Gaylord Focker impersonation in a home game of Meet the Parents.</p>\u000A<p>I played like a donk in the first of two four-handed games between me, The Gladiator, Matski and Prem.</p>\u000A<p>Getting way too cute and trying to trap with good hands, I simply gave free cards to my opponents and fell into the hole myself before being first out. Matski eventually took the cash after going heads-up with Glad.</p>\u000A<p>I turned things around in the second game though, playing a game more suited to four-handed poker but did trap nicely when it fit myhand and the board.</p>\u000A<p>After a fun period of all ins and calls with Blind Prem-on, I took a monster pot from Matski with a straight made on the turn and ended heads-up with our host again.</p>\u000A<p>Made an aggressive call to end it all when I held 4d-2d in the big blind and Glad limped in. The flop fell 9d-5c-2s, I bet out with bottom pair about half the pot and got called.</p>\u000A<p>The turn was a Kd and I bet out about two-thirds the pot, only to be re-raised all in. Time to make a read.</p>\u000A<p>I didn't put him on a king and felt his push was designed to move me off as I'd been taking down pots with raises since starting heads-up. I had a 2-1 chip advantage and if I made the call I'd still have enough left behind to play with if beaten.</p>\u000A<p>While I wasn't getting the right pot odds, I did have the nine outs with the flush draw (if he had two diamonds, so be it, I'm not laying down a flush heads-up), another two with the ducks and possibly three more with the fours.</p>\u000A<p>Not only that, but I thought there was probably a 25/30% chance that Glad was making a move with nothing, maybe Q or J high so that had to be factored in with the outs.</p>\u000A<p>I decided to gamble and take a chance to collect the cash there and then - right ....... there. I made the call and the river was a lovely four as Glad revealed 9-7 and I'd finally won one after what seemed like a long barren spell.</p>\u000A<p>Enjoy the weekend<br />\u000AShuffle up and deal</p>

V<p>Its not all done and dusted yet - but since the year of 2007 is almost over, it's probably a good time to reminisce on the events past.</p>\u000A<p>For the fashion world, no one could've expected what events and trends came to be. The trends varied from structured, flowing, masculine, hobo (yet again), rave (thanks to Jeremy Scott), punk, and preppy. Oh and billboard Tees. Cheers House of Holland.</p>\u000A<p>There were <em>Star Wars-</em>style C-3PO Balenciaga leggings designed by the ridiculously talented Nicolas Ghesquière for the Spring 2007 collection, retailing for a cool $159,000 - which brings back the nice and (usually forgotten) idea that money is not an object when it comes to style, and that not everybody needs to blow money on "vintage" pieces to call themselves unique.</p>\u000A<p><img vspace="5" src="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/10m.jpg" hspace="5" alt="10m.jpg" title="10m.jpg" /></p>\u000A<p>There was Hermes, who created their classic Birkin with Crocodile skin and diamonds retailing for $148,000, and artist Damien Hirst, who made a <strong>life-size human skull</strong> encrusted with 8601 diamonds which sold for a reported $122 million.</p>\u000A<p><img vspace="5" src="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/1724248531_d87fba7bae_o.jpg" hspace="5" alt="1724248531_d87fba7bae_o.jpg" title="1724248531_d87fba7bae_o.jpg" /></p>\u000A<p>As for fashion shows, Fendi took the cake with their $10,000,000 show, which was situated on none other than the <strong>Great Wall of China</strong>. Designer Karl Lagerfeld was also quick to point out: "The wall is built to be a runway, huh? They don't have to use it for fighting Mongolians anymore; now they can use it for fashion."As for NZ, who could forget our fashion week? I know. Me too.</p>\u000A<p><img vspace="5" src="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/1112912177_a9fe12a1aa.jpg" hspace="5" alt="1112912177_a9fe12a1aa.jpg" title="1112912177_a9fe12a1aa.jpg" /></p>\u000A<p>It was also interesting to see the emerging trend of designers using the run-down dregs of celebrities as muses for campaigns, collections and media - and I'm not talking Lorraine Downes for Petrena Miller. I'm thinking more along the lines of <strong>Karl Lagerfeld and Courtney Love</strong>. The woman was so high she couldn't even tell she was wearing a fake! And now the legendary designer finds inspiration in the woman? See this is what I'm talking about when I say that this year has been highly unpredictable.</p>\u000A<p>Then there was the "Skinny Debate". C'mon people! Do you think models are paid to sit on fat asses? No. They're paid to be skinny. They always have been and they always will be. If ads looked better shot with average-sized people - then chances are the models would all be out of work.</p>\u000A<p>The year 2007 also lost one of the most fashion-forward people in the business: Isabella Blow. Her signature style was the inspiration for the exhibition which came to our part of the world with "When Phillip met Isabella" at the NewDowse in Wellington.</p>\u000A<p>And for 2008? Well after this year all I can really say "who knows"? But out with the old and in with the new!</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/1112912177_a9fe12a1aa.jpg" title="1112912177_a9fe12a1aa.jpg"></a></p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/1724248531_d87fba7bae_o.jpg" title="1724248531_d87fba7bae_o.jpg"></a></p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/10m.jpg" title="10m.jpg"></a></p>

George Mitchell's report concerning use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball. The report was the product of a 21-month, multimillion dollar investigation that could shape decisions, prompt punitive actions against active players, and usher in the next era of the sport.</p>\u000A<p>Free agent Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees, Miguel Tejada of the Houston Astros, Eric Gagne of the Milwaukee Brewers and Paul Lo Duca of the Washington Nationals were among the most prominent former and current All-Stars to be mentioned in the lengthy report, (and by lengthy I mean 409 pages!). The report also contains multiple exhibits, including evidence of signed checks, handwritten notes and shipping receipts.</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/destruction_of_national_pastime"><img width="222" height="319" align="left" src="http://www.dropkicks.co.nz/modules/htmlarea/Xinha/plugins/ImageManager/image_uploads/_2007_12/Barry_Bonds_3.jpg" alt="Barry_Bonds_3.jpg" />­</a>The report was delivered with the backdrop of Barry Bonds having just pleaded not guilty last week in a San Francisco federal court on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice. This is conjunction with BALCO and we know how well that ended for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL1220829120071212">Marion Jones</a>.</p>\u000A<p>But the report is not all doom and horse juice. It also contains a number of recommendations for MLB to move forward.</p>\u000A<p>Have I read it yet? Did I mention 409 pages? I have just got to the end of the list of contents.</p>\u000A<p>But for your reading pleasure the MLB have <a href="http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf">uploaded the pdf</a> (6.47Mb) so you can download and read at your leisure (apprently they are working on an easy clickable version too).</p>

Mahanama is no fan of Australian pace bowling, and one person not on his Christmas card list is caravan-lover Glenn McGrath. In his autobiography, the Sri Lankan <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/31maha.htm"><strong>accused</strong></a> the Australian paceman of calling Sanath Jayasuriya a "black monkey" in the 1995/96 World Series. McGrath, predictably, denied the accusation.</p>\u000A<p>Speaking of alleged chuckers and Sri Lankans, <strong>Muttiah Muralitharan </strong>has been honoured with a (dreadful) song by Aussie-based Lankan Alston Koch. Brace yourself when you download <em>Murali</em> from <a target="_blank" href="http://mcricket.mobi/download_song.jsp?id=18D8136CAAB5E00A455AAE2042086666"><strong>here</strong></a>. We will also be reviewing it on The BYC <a target="_blank" href="http://beigebrigade.co.nz/loop/byc/"><strong>podcast</strong></a> this week. According to World Music Central, Alston has been "a leading Sri Lankan musician since the 1960s...Koch performed at all the well-known night clubs in Ceylon including the Coconut Grove in Colombo". Sounds a bit like <strong>John Rowles</strong>.</p>\u000A<p>A <em>Sideline Slogger </em>reader with impeccable credentials has done the economic analysis and reckons <strong>Dan Vettori</strong>, <strong>Jacob Oram </strong>and <strong>Jeetan Patel </strong>are our best bets for bowling at the death after running the numbers over recent efforts in the last 10 overs. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/blogs/sidelineslogger/2007/12/06/the-underarm-wker-series/"><strong>The Economist</strong></a>, X-Box fan Mark Gillespie's record is not as good as any of these three and he's more expensive than other contenders, Scotty Styris and Kyle Mills.</p>\u000A<p><img border="5" vspace="5" align="right" width="351" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Fonterra_Facility_Near_Hamilton.jpg/800px-Fonterra_Facility_Near_Hamilton.jpg" hspace="5" height="253" />Quote of the week is from <em>The Daily Star </em>in Bangladesh: "The team bus took the Tigers to <strong>Hamilton</strong> to their Novotel Tainui Hotel...past breathtaking greenery, lovely single storey houses and livestock grazing the valleys on both sides of the road like you find in picture books. Adding to the atmosphere was the absence of a siren blowing police or security escort which just would not have fitted with the level of tranquility around."</p>\u000A<p>Finally, here is an <strong>In-form New Zealand XI</strong>, selected solely from those playing in the State Championship domestic competition. The <em>Sideline Slogger </em>joins them in banging on the selectors' doors and yelling: "Come on!" The XI is: Matthew Bell, Aaron Redmond, Peter Fulton, Greg Hay, Greg Todd, Neal Parlane, Reece Young, Andre Adams, Brandon Hiini, Bradley Scott, Andy McKay. Honourable mention: Charlie Shreck (England). Bell and Adams are stitching together increasingly compelling cases to be selected ahead of incumbents Michael Papps and Iain O'Brien.</p>

(lp3143
sg10
V<p>A mate of mine had a rather interesting run-in last night with a couple of drunken Tory backbenchers. Here's what happened:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p>Last night I was at the Malthouse in Courtenay Place having a few beers with some mates when who should walk into the bar but a couple of National Party backbenchers. We struck up a conversation, and an enlightening one it was. Both Nats had clearly had a few and the rookie\u2019s tongue was looser than I would have thought wise (I noticed his more experienced colleague was far more reserved).</p>\u000A<p>He readily agreed that John Key comes across as \u2018a bit smug but he\u2019s a tough bugger and he works us like dogs, as he should\u2019.  We were assured that \u2018she\u2019 (Clark, presumably) would \u2018knock that smugness out of him in the campaign\u2019. </p>\u000A<p>We were then told that \u2018John doesn\u2019t really know what he wants to do if (when, hah!) he becomes Prime Minister and he certainly hasn\u2019t told us!\u2019 But, then \u2018He\u2019s new to politics; he shouldn\u2019t know what he wants. He\u2019s just got to hit the right notes with the public\u2019. I gained a striking impression that power was being sought for its own sake, not to make a better New Zealand.  </p>\u000A<p>Searching for some glimmer of a vision, the Nats were asked about where they thought the country should head. \u2018Singapore\u2019 was the answer: we should be looking to a city-state on the world\u2019s busiest shipping strait that is run as a mix of autocracy and plutocracy as the model.  Every mention of vision or policy was solely limited to economics: people appeared in the frame merely as commodities and factors of production.</p>\u000A<p>So, maintain and fortify privilege for those who have it, that\u2019s name of the game, and do so by \u2018hitting the right notes\u2019.</p>\u000A<p>\u2018John\u2019, we were informed, \u2018could hit the right notes about 85% of the time\u2019 much better than \u2018English, who only gets it right 65% of the time\u2019 (note who gets first names, the faction this backbencher sat in was clear).</p>\u000A<p>At this point the slightly nervous-looking, more experienced politician decided it was time they extracted themselves before his friend started telling us intimate details of caucus sessions. We were left amused but more than a little concerned that this is the true face of the National party behind Key\u2019s grinning façade.</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I imagine the rookie had more than his hangover to worry about this morning.</p>\u000A<p class="akst_link"><a href="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/?p=869&amp;akst_action=share-this" title="E-mail this, post to del.icio.us, etc." id="akst_link_869" class="akst_share_link" rel="nofollow">Share This</a>\u000A</p>

V<p>Local Nats don't want David Carter as their candidate for Selwyn.</p>\u000A<p>Looks like the threats, intimidation and bullying tactics used to get him the candidacy have backfired for him. Carter (himself a three time loser to Labour's Ruth Dyson in Banks Peninsula) has a history of bagging other candidates within his party.</p>\u000A<p>He said of Brian Connell, when selected for Rakaia in 2002, that National "didn't get a hell of a good line-up of candidates... they weren't bad but there was nobody who was a stunner" (Chch Press, 3 Oct 2006).</p>\u000A<p>Well the local party people didn't toss Brian Connell back quite as fast as they're trying to bin David Carter - they're right to of course because in his own words - he isn't a stunner either.</p>\u000A<p>My bet is that John Key will still want him to win the selection and that Carter will be forced on the electorate against the wishes of the local Nats. Democracy - National style.</p>\u000A<p>From the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4323181a19720.html">Press</a> this morning:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><strong>National reopens Selwyn race</strong></p>\u000A<p>National MP David Carter will battle up to 12 rival candidates for the Selwyn seat after the party's board agreed to an embarrassing selection rerun.</p>\u000A<p>Nominations for electorates across the country have closed, but National president Judy Kirk said yesterday the board had decided to reopen the Selwyn contest in February after 35 party members lodged a formal complaint...</p>\u000A<p>It is understood the candidates were warned several front-bench National MPs would publicly campaign for Carter to get the nod if they put their names forward.</p>\u000A<p>Carter's colleagues felt such a senior MP should not have to face a selection battle against newcomers...</p>\u000A<p>In its complaint to the board, the disgruntled group of party members said Carter should have known the selection process was flawed. "His future as a Cabinet minister will often put him under the spotlight and, if this is a sign of his true judgment, then we may be headed for turbulent times with him as a minister of the Crown," the letter says...</p></blockquote>\u000A<p class="akst_link"><a href="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/?p=868&amp;akst_action=share-this" title="E-mail this, post to del.icio.us, etc." id="akst_link_868" class="akst_share_link" rel="nofollow">Share This</a>\u000A</p>

V<p>Here's a clip that aired last night on TV3.</p>\u000A<p>It shows NZ leading the world in our response to climate change in Bali. To quote the reporter, New Zealand is "...putting words into action... [announcing] ambitious plans to go carbon neutral".</p>\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A<p>\u000A<p>National on the other hand has no credibility on climate change. They don't have any real answers.

In terms of conflict - Iraq. In terms of wider issues it's about global warming. In both cases, John Key has got it wrong."</p>\u000A<p>Evidently Key's personal ambition doesn't stretch as far as helping to save the planet.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/28_large1.thumbnail.jpg" title="28_large1.jpg" alt="28_large1.jpg" height="72" hspace="5" width="50" /></p>\u000A<p><strong>\u201C[Climate change] is a complete and utter hoax.\u201D</strong><br />\u000A<em> (Hansard, 10 May 2005)</em></p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/billenglish.thumbnail.jpg" title="billenglish.jpg" alt="billenglish.jpg" height="71" hspace="5" width="50" /></p>\u000A<p><strong>\u201C[I\u2019m] quite worried that policies are going to be driven by this Armageddon mentality that the world has\u2026 far too much carbon.\u201D</strong><br />\u000A<em> (Investigate, Feb 2007)</em></p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/44_large.thumbnail.jpg" title="44_large.jpg" alt="44_large.jpg" height="68" hspace="5" width="50" /></p>\u000A<p><strong>\u201CI am a climate change sceptic.
