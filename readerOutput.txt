V<h3>The Social Report is out</h3>I'm a bit pissed off that the <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz"> Social Report</a>, which is finally out,  is only available on the web, now. It means I`ll have to be near a computer to read it and I wont  get my hard copy like in previous years. The media people from the MSD are a bit miffed about it too. It means that you can't get it out of any libraries, and if you don't have access  to a computer you simply cant read it.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThat is a real shame - the excuse is the standard one: cost-cutting.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6671521-4377212425998684305?l=big-news.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigNews/~4/qPyHAwrIZMM" height="1" width="1" />

V<h3>More "chilling" than the Electoral Finance Act</h3><blockquote><i>Sweeping powers to spy, bug conversations and hack into private computers could be given to a web of state agencies as diverse as Inland Revenue and the Meat Board<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThe Human Rights Commission<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10604944"> yesterday warned Parliament</a> of the "chilling" implications of a proposed law that would see the intrusive powers usually only available to the police extended to all agencies with enforcement responsibilities.It said that under the law, council dog control officers would be able to enter homes to install a surveillance device and the Commerce Commission would be able to detain people.</i></blockquote>Righto. What's going on, here? Someone give me one good reason why the Inland Revenue, Meat Board, local councils, Overseas Investment Office, Accident Compensation Corporation, Environment Risk Management Authority, the COmmerce Commission, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Pork Industry Board should either get enforcement powers, be able to install surveillance devices in your home, and detain people without a warrant.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AIf the Pork Industry Board comes anywhere near my house I`ll be ringing the pigs.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6671521-5806633128348893029?l=big-news.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigNews/~4/kkvX1vjq9jE" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>We have previously looked at <a href="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/2009/09/a-future-of-on-line-finance-from-brokers-to-blogs-to-yahoo/">a view of the future of on-line finance</a>. In that analysis we looked a range of scenarios:</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/new-picture-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-921" title="new-picture-1" src="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/new-picture-1-635x377.png" alt="new-picture-1" width="635" height="377" /></a></p>\u000A<p>One of the scenarios being Rock Stars.  We described the Rock Star scenario as:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><span lang="EN-NZ"><strong>Rock Stars</strong> \u2013 Retail investors seek advice from communities of other investors and are willing to pay.<span> </span>Investors make their trading accounts transparent on-line. Successful investors open their accounts to act as virtual fund managers. Virtual fund managers and community owners split a management fee paid by investors.<span> </span><strong>Winners</strong> \u2013 <a href="http://www.covestor.com/">Covestor</a>, <a href="http://www.kaching.com/kaching#home">KaChing</a>.</span></p></blockquote>\u000A<p><span lang="EN-NZ">Last week <a href="http://twitter.com/kaChingInc">Dan Carroll</a> and the team at KaChing announced their new offering - and started to show how this scenario may play out. There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/technology/start-ups/19kaching.html?_r=1&ref=business">feature in the NY Times</a> which described the business model.<br />\u000A</span></p>\u000A<blockquote><p>Customers will be able to open a brokerage account with Interactive Brokers and link their account with their choice of investors on KaChing. KaChing charges customers a single management fee of 0.25 percent to 3 percent, set by each investor. KaChing keeps a quarter of the fee, and the investors get the rest.</p>\u000A<p>Each time the investors make a trade, KaChing will automatically make the same trades for the customer. Customers can log on whenever they want to check their portfolio\u2019s performance. They can send the investor private messages and receive alerts if the investor does something unusual. With the click of a mouse, customers can stop mirroring an investor.</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>KaChing has an <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaching">A-list team of investors</a> behind them. The on-line finance space has a lot of interesting experiments going on - but we think this is a particularly interesting one. A lot of us will be watching closely how KaChing goes.</p>\u000A<p>Disclosure: I met Dan and Jonathan from KaChing at the FinovateStartup09 event in San Francisco in April 2009. We had the stand next door. Good guys, smart guys - doing interesting things.</p>

VOver the years, the struggle at Oxford University between the establishment and kiwi Vice-Chancellor Dr John Hood ran with remarkable parallels to Tom Sharpe's novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porterhouse_Blue">Porterhouse Blue</a>. In both reality and fiction, a new head of university arrives with modern ideas, and departs after stiff opposition from stubborn traditionalists.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AAt least Dr Hood gets off better than his parallel does in the novel. <a href="http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/david-cohen/influential-british-magazine-salutes-kiwi-business-leader">David Cohen at NBR</a> notes that at least <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5438693/the-man-who-saved-oxford-university.thtml">one establishment figure</a> eulogises for the departing VC.

He could have been science advisor to Helen Clark.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AWhat now for Dr Hood? I'd like to see him appointed as head of a complete review of NZ's university system.

VThe Economist sez <a href="http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14710635&source=hptextfeature">Russia is looking at plans to quadruple beer excise taxes by 2012</a>. The tax is to allegedly tackle alcoholism, which is so rife it is almost a prerequisite for Russian citizenship. The slight hiccup? The tax increase applies only to beer, not vodka:<br />\u000A<blockquote>The average Russian already drinks 30 litres of hard liquor a year, six times the amount in the EU, while imbibing a modest 77 litres of beer, a little less than a typical European. Pushing up beer prices is far more likely to encourage drinkers to swallow even more vodka or dodgy but cheap home-made spirits than to convince them to give up booze altogether.<br />\u000A</blockquote><a href="http://www.awa.dk/glosary/slainte.htm#R">Budem zdorovy</a>!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8544114-1110898379438088140?l=gonzofreakpower.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GonzoFreakpowerBrainsTrust/~4/bT2vVfYxXQM" height="1" width="1" />

V<div>Damien Hirst is perhaps one of the most well known post-modernist artists, who would have remained obscure had Charles Saatchi not bought his work.  He's known for creations such as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physical_Impossibility_of_Death_in_the_Mind_of_Someone_Living">The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</a>", basically a shark in formaldehyde.  He devised diamond encrusted skulls ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Love_of_God_%28artwork%29">For the Love of God</a>"), preserved and <a href="http://www.af-moma.no/images/D_hirst_mother_and_child_divided%280%29.jpg">dissected a cow and calf</a> and even commented on the 9/11 attack as such "<span>You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating</span>" before apologising to the families and friends of the victims.<br /><br />I find it all quite vile.  Hirst appears to worship death, so perhaps the irony of his latest works is that they have lent themselves to the death of his career.   Perhaps art critics were waiting for the day to excoriate Hirst, for having little more than imagination and the patronage of those with the aesthetic values of rats.   Hirst handed them the day, and they went for it like sharks.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/oct/26/damien-hirst-modern-art">Jonathan Jones in the Guardian says it beautifully</a> as follows:<br /><br />"<span>Hirst's exhibition is a stupefying admission of defeat, a self-obliterating homage, that reveals the most successful artist of our time to be a tiny talent, with less to offer than even the most obscure Victorian painter in the Wallace Collection</span>"<br /><br />You see Hirst has painted, it has been exhibited, and it shows he cannot paint.  Many have said so in damning terms:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/oct/18/damien-hirst-no-love-lost">Peter Conrad in the Observer</a>:  "<span>Bumptiously confronting Titian, Poussin and other venerable elders at the Wallace Collection, Hirst is enjoying his temporary ownership of the trampled, desecrated earth. But he's not a legitimate heir and the Wallace Collection is playing host to a jumped-up pretender.</span>"<br /><br /><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/6329047/It-couldnt-get-worse-for-Damien-Hirst.html">Mark Hudson in the Daily Telegraph</a>: "<span>Hirst's presumption in comparison with the technical inadequacy of the work was simply unforgiveable. For once, chutzpah wasn't enough.</span>"<br /><br />Tom Lubbock in The Independent:  "<span>Hirst, as a painter, is at about the level of a not-very-promising, first-year art student</span>" and how about why there is attention at all given to Hirst? "<span>A few quick questions. 1. Are these new paintings, painted by Damien Hirst himself, any good? No, not at all, they are not worth looking at. 2. So why are you writing about them at such length? Because he is very famous. 3. And why has the Wallace Collection decided to exhibit them? Because he is very famous. 4. And why did Damien Hirst even paint them in the first place? Because he is very famous.</span>"<br /><br /><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6872591.ece">The Times</a> "<span>The paintings are dreadful. Think Francis Bacon meets Adrian Mole</span>."<br /><br /><br />Jones concludes that Hirst himself has now shown this age of art to be a fraud:<br /><br /><span>Hirst has said: I want to be compared directly with the old masters, on their own turf, in their own visual language. In his eyes, it would seem that all the readymades, all the vitrines \u2013 all the ideas that have made him rich \u2013 are not real art at all. They are substitutes for the art he wishes he could make. The one truly great art, in his eyes, is the high western tradition of oil painting.<br /><br />He can't do that at all; can't paint his way out of a paper bag. But don't kid yourselves. It is not just Hirst who is implicated in this exposure. It is an entire idea of art that triumphed in the 1990s and still dominates our culture \u2013 an entire age of the readymade stands accused by its own creator of being a charade. </span><br /><br />Ouch.   So well deserved, may the charade be well and truly over.   Do I see Tracey Emin hiding looking confused as to what to do next?</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a type="application/rss+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> RSS feed for this site</a>\u000A\u000A<a type="application/atom+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> ATOM feed for this site</a><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15768887-9048090093617557320?l=libertyscott.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibertyScott/~4/Wo3R4lcFJKE" height="1" width="1" />

V<a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/preschool-greenwash-scaring-children/story-e6freuy9-1225791148619">Australia's Daily Telegraph writes</a> "<span>Tots as young as three have sent letters to Kevin Rudd about their passion for green living and asked companies to reduce their packaging</span>"<br /><br />At one time the secular left would damn Christians for frightening children with the awful scary stories from the Bible, teaching them that if they sinned they'd go to hell.  Now small children are being taught the world is coming to an end, and one of their key responsibilities is to "do something" about it, not unlike the Leninist form of brainwashing of children at schools to support the socialist state and fight the "imperialists".<br /><br />Young children should NOT be worrying about the world, their chief concerns should be their own life, about school, family, friends and their possessions.  To get small children to write to a Prime Minister about the environment is grotesque propagandising.<br /><br />Imagine if a school got young children to write to the Prime Minister demanding taxes be cut, or that the government expand the armed forces or cut spending so they don't face a huge debt when they start working.    The green left would be outraged, but its own scaremongering and politics are treated as "fact".<br /><br />The Green Party in NZ embraces this as its<a href="http://www.greens.org.nz/policy/education"> education policy explicitly states</a>:<br /><br />"<span>Incorporate environmental education (including energy efficiency and conservation) into the core curriculum at all levels and ensure that teacher education and training programmes allocate<span> significant time</span> for environmental education</span>."  and<br /><br />"<span># Establish permanent environmental education regional advisory positions and encourage the further development of national resources to develop ecological thinking across the curriculum.<br /># Expand ERO reporting to include environmental education</span>."<br /><br /><div>Of course if you want your children to be taught about this, then good luck to you.   I'd let schools teach as they see fit, but it should NOT be part of the curriculum of every school.   I'd argue strongly it would be far preferable to teach children personal autonomy, so they respect each others' rights to control their property and bodies - something children should learn in relation to each other.   Frightening little children to think the world is going to end serves only one purpose, and it isn't the interests of the children.<br /><br />(Hat Tip:  <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/timblair/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/green_is_bad/">Tim Blair</a>)</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a type="application/rss+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> RSS feed for this site</a>\u000A\u000A<a type="application/atom+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> ATOM feed for this site</a><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15768887-484543171430771136?l=libertyscott.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibertyScott/~4/NGVu-U7jUYg" height="1" width="1" />

V<div>With the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10605469">NZ Herald reporting</a> Local Government Minister Rodney Hide unable to get National Party support to constrain the powers of local authorities, and unwilling to push it further, it seems like New Zealand is now stuck with a policy on local government driven by Sandra Lee when she was Minister of Local Government in 2001.<br /><br />In the Local Government Act 2002, pushed by Lee and supported by Labour, local authorities were given the "power of general competence" to pursue the "economic, social, environmental and cultural well-being" of their communities.   In other words, they not only could do whatever they wished, within the bounds of other laws, but they had a "duty" to consider those four "dimensions" of community development.   It implied that councils not only could, but should be involved in economic development, promoting arts and culture and having a social welfare role of sorts.<br /><br />National and ACT voted against this when it was in Parliament, but just to show "Plus ça change", it means nothing.  <a href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com/2009/05/three-bills-on-auckland-mega-city.html">The concerns expressed at the time</a> have evaporated.<br /><br />National has effectively adopted the local government policy promulgated by Labour and the Alliance. <a href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com/2009/04/sorry-rodney-it-doesnt-answer-question.html"> None of ACT's local government policy</a> looks like coming to pass.<br /><br />What does this mean for the supercity?  <a href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com/2009/08/rodney-stopped-something-bad-getting.html">Well my warnings that the supercity does not look constrained are right.</a><br /><br />Auckland will have a mega city, with mega powers, and no constraints on its power.  Even Rodney Hide now believes the majority can pillage the minority by saying:<br /><br /><span>"If a community want something and are prepared to pay for it, that's fine</span>".<br /><br />Rodney, if the community are so willing to pay for it, why the hell is the council making them pay?   What does local government have to do with choice?<br /><br />Mildly tinkering with transparency doesn't ratchet things back.<br /><br />No.  On local government the left has won, the ACT enthusiasts who think an Auckland mega city will vote to the "right" and constrain council spending (presumably with downtown railway tunnel enthusiast John Banks as Mayor), are deluding themselves.   They have at least surrendered the rest of the country for their rose coloured view of the mega city.    Frankly, it's a view that I could understand from National, which is as embedded in local government as the Labour Party, but that's it.<br /><br />Rodney Hide and John Key are essentially adopting a legal framework and policy of the Alliance and Labour parties on local government.<br /><br />Is this what you voted for?<br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a type="application/rss+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> RSS feed for this site</a>\u000A\u000A<a type="application/atom+xml" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com"> ATOM feed for this site</a><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15768887-3375943432966149764?l=libertyscott.blogspot.com" /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibertyScott/~4/edGf5n-b2Q4" height="1" width="1" />

VSpending on welfare - "...engine of the domestic economy."

VDid you know that, <a href="http://gordoncampbell.scoop.co.nz/2009/10/27/campbell-cuts-to-central-local-govt-spending/">according</a> to Gordon Campbell;<br /><br /><blockquote><span>It seems to have eluded Federated Farmers economic spokesperson Philip York at least \u2013 just as it eluded Ruth Richardson \u2013 that spending on welfare is one of the engines of the domestic economy. Beneficiaries spend the money that they get from the state in local shops \u2013 not on overseas trips or on luxury imports.</span></blockquote><br /><br />So if we want a strong and growing economy, what we need is <span>more</span> spending on welfare. If that were so than during the rapid growth period of welfare (last 40 years) NZ's per capita income would have climbed relative to the rest of the developed world. It hasn't.<br /><br />Or perhaps he means we just need to maintain current levels of spending, at the very least, to prop up the economy.<br /><br />But the money being redistributed to beneficiaries is money that cannot be spent in investment and job creation.<br /><br />It is no good talking up a group's collective consuming power if, eventually, there isn't a commensurate producer. This isn't chicken and egg stuff. The production has to come first. And production requires labour.<br /><br /><blockquote><span>Same story with the low paid. It has been estimated for instance, that 2/3 of this year\u2019s wage rise to staff at Progressive\u2019s supermarkets will be spent back at Progressive, on groceries. The money circulates back through retailers, and government gets some of it back in tax.</span></blockquote><br /><br />No. It is not the same story with the working low paid. They add value to the economy with their labour. Their earnings are not taken away from the productive sector with no return. Wealth redistribution through voluntary means - paid employment - is entirely different from redistribution through government coercion.<br /><br />I do not, and never have, advocated cutting benefit payment levels. However, and I am sorry to repeat myself, a stop to the ongoing inflow of new beneficiairies is urgent. That, and a progressive raising of the qualifying age for Super would see a steady decline in welfare spending. That would drop the proportion of government spending as a percentage of GDP. That will make NZ a wealthier country.<br /><br /><blockquote><span>It is impossible to estimate the social cost in crime, marital breakdown and mental health problems that have resulted from this ongoing pressure on benefit levels and entitlements.</span></blockquote><br /><br />Almost as impossible as trying to estimate the cost in crime, marital breakdown and mental health problems that have resulted from benefit dependency itself. Again all of those aspects of life have become more commonplace on the back of the growth in the welfare state. They may have worsened in the early nineties but they were already well-entrenched compared to life before the culture of entitlement and hand-outs arrived.<br /><br />I am not an economist but this claim is as nutty to me as the one that goes, I may be a beneficiary but I still pay tax. I make my contribution.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/19962237-3045217232099641678?l=lindsaymitchell.blogspot.com" /></div>

VMy age is beginning to betray me. I seem out of touch with the new kind of <span>gung ho</span> approach by politicians. The fostering of solidarity and admiration among an audience that is most impressed by seeing them as 'good sports' and 'a laugh' and 'one of us'. Perhaps they figure that is the best they can do in a recession and a positive contribution to the countries morale is better than nothing.<br /><br />A newish comedy <a href="http://www.tv3.co.nz/TVShows/Comedy/7Days/tabid/925/Default.aspx?showid=17981&listingID=1225845">show</a> screens on TV3 called <span>7 Days</span>.  It's a stock in trade competition between two teams of comedians responding to leading from a adjudicator. It had me laughing out loud on Friday night. Then in rolled the Minister for Social Development (I suppose a new comedy show is a form of social development). Rolled because she had to roll in her own seat and sit in the middle. She then participated in that old game whereby  you must never answer a question with 'yes' or 'no'. Probably not much of a challenge for a politician. Questions like "Have you ever done it in the back of a Holden?" answered by, "Who hasn't?". At which point I had stopped laughing and began using all my energy trying to process what I am seeing and figure out why 'we are not unamused'.<br /><br />It's not very dignified. So what? Stop being such a pompous twit Lindsay. But aren't we supposed to take this person seriously? She is in charge of the government's biggest spending portfolio. In which case she is allowed to have some fun for a change. Give her a break. But I spend so much of my frigging time worrying about welfare and she's positively chirruping. In which case she has a better work/life balance than you and you could do worse than take a leaf from her book. But what would an overseas visitor make of it all? Who is that, they would ask. Oh that's just the government minister in charge of child protection services, the disability sector, care of the aged and reduction of family violence. She must be up to the job because she can make people laugh.<br /><br />So my discomfit is without foundation. It doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It can only be explained by my age and the expectations I have because of it. I am a dinosaur with an attitude that says there is a time and a place; portraying a level of discipline publicly is important; maintaining a certain distance and anonymity is desirable; but above all, when there is serious, urgent work to be done there is no time for personality parades.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/19962237-1737897806215036100?l=lindsaymitchell.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p><em>Enjoy your long weekend?&nbsp; </em><a title="SUS'S SOUNDBITES" href="http://www.libertarianz.org.nz/soundbites/"><em>Susan Ryder</em></a><em> did.</em></p> <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SuXgewuxxBI/AAAAAAAAIT4/WEYLjoGiDRs/s1600-h/susanryder%5B4%5D.jpg"><img title="susanryder" border="0" alt="susanryder" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SuXggocFjWI/AAAAAAAAIT8/0nkfzHZfKXg/susanryder_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="100" height="163" /></a> Long weekends are great for those of us who get to enjoy them and I\u2019ve always loved Labour Weekend in particular, especially when I was younger, especially because I have a birthday at this time of year. I still love the holiday; still love the birthday, too; only more the celebration these days than the change of number. Goodness knows who I offended in the interim, though, because the gods seemed determined to upset my applecart this year. <p>Firstly, circumstances conspired to prevent me from attending my own party some 500km away on Sunday afternoon. Pity, because it was destined to be a cracker with seven birthdays from the 19<sup>th</sup> to the 30<sup>th</sup> celebrating a combined 400+ years at a lovely place in the country near the Kapiti Coast. I\u2019m told that a terrific time was had by all, so I\u2019ll have to finagle an invitation for next year. (And if any miserable sod has stopped to do the maths, I must point out that the others were <i>loads</i> older than me!) <p>But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m writing about. On Saturday morning, my parents awoke to find their front lawn destroyed.  <p>They\u2019ve spent the last few months re-landscaping their whole property. \u201CShe\u2019s a pretty big job\u201D as my wee Mitre 10 mate from New Zealand\u2019s greatest ever television commercial would sagely say. On Friday, they spent hours cutting and laying the rolls of new grass. My nephews helped, too, their primary school being closed for the day. So it was a hell of a shock the next morning to pull back the living room drapes to admire their handiwork and see anything but. During the night, vandals had hopped over the low fence and torn everything up, throwing it all over the place and stomping on gardens in the process. I happened to ring shortly after they\u2019d discovered the mess. <p>\u201CRing the police!\u201D I said, amid a few choice epithets. <p>\u201CWhat for?\u201D said Mum. \u201CThey never turn up for things like this anymore!\u201D <p>\u201CWell, I realise <i>that</i>\u201D I replied. \u201CBut it\u2019s to register the damage, otherwise they can\u2019t know. And the bastards may well have damaged other properties along the way. \u201D <p>To be fair, my mother was put through to a decent chap. During the conversation she learned that her call to the local police station had been automatically rerouted to Palmerston North, the local station being closed until today. He was courteous and sympathetic, but there was little he could do except to record the complaint and advise her to make a statement at her local station after the long weekend. <p>It\u2019s pertinent that my parents\u2019 home is on a main road \u2013 State Highway 1 in fact \u2013 and well lit. Traffic is constant right throughout the night, which is likely why the vandals weren\u2019t heard. Worryingly, this blatant crime also gives credence to the suspicions of many residents in smaller locations that nightly police patrols are virtually non-existent, a sentiment with which my sister has recent experience in the same town. <p>A couple of weeks ago she and her husband were awoken at 1.30am by a crowd of people making a hell of a noise out on the footpath in front of their home on a quiet residential street. As far as she could ascertain, the crowd was trying to uproot the street sign on the corner \u2013 as you do in the early hours of a weekday morning. They didn\u2019t want their young children to wake up frightened, or the crowd to get any ideas of further trespass upon their property or those of their neighbours, so rang the same police station to request an urgent call-out. Unfortunately, the man she spoke with wasn\u2019t quite as concerned as the police officer in Palmerston North. <p>\u201CHow many of them are there?\u201D he enquired. <p>\u201CWell, I can\u2019t say exactly! But there\u2019s quite a few out there and we want them to go \u2013 now!\u201D <p>\u201CWhat do they look like? Can you describe them?\u201D he persisted. <p>\u201COh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201D she said, \u201CI\u2019m peering out of my window through the trees into the darkness and I don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself. All I can tell you is that they\u2019re wearing hoods, there are a lot of them, they\u2019re making a racket and it\u2019s really scary.\u201D <p>I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been so polite. I\u2019d have asked him if he would prefer that I put on my dressing gown and slippers and pop out with the phone and let him have a personal chat to get the bloody details! In spite of this occurring no more than one kilometre from the police station, nobody ever showed up or followed up. Finally frustrated in their efforts to fully upend the street sign, the crowd contented themselves with hauling out some shrubs from a neighbouring property before eventually buggering off. <p>This sort of nuisance property crime occurs all too often \u2013 and is ignored all too often. We can date political unconcern back to the 1980s when former Police Minister Ann Hercus said that she was only worried about violent crime, a point previously noted on this blog. I wonder if she ever read Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s <i>The Tipping Point</i> that subsequently proved the wisdom of nipping minor crime in the bud. In spite of all the predictable talk prior to every election, no Police Minister has acted differently since. <p>So now we have Judith Collins, who recently made headlines with her potential get-tough policy with nuisance motorists. I\u2019d like to draw Ms Collins\u2019s attention to the ongoing neglect of authority toward property crime and policing in general. And I\u2019d like to know what she\u2019s going to do about it. <p>The elephant in the sitting room is, of course, several decades of excessive state welfare where losers are paid to screw losers with no regard for the consequences including ensuing children. But it\u2019s no use expecting any reform in that department. I say that based on a letter I received from Social Development Minister Paula Bennett last week, an excerpt of which I forwarded to welfare activist <a title="LINDSAY MITCHELL" href="http://www.lindsaymitchell.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Lindsay Mitchell</a> who compared it with comments made by Labour\u2019s Steve Maharey when he held the portfolio, to discover that it was virtually identical in sentiment. <p>With regard to policing priorities, there\u2019s this little gem to finish with. <p>Getting out of Wellington is a slow form of torture every Friday afternoon, but holiday weekends are the proverbial nightmare. After contending with the build-up at Paremata, there is the obligatory crawl through Paraparaumu and Waikanae as a result of the Kapiti Coast District Council digging in its dark green heels to prevent construction of the western bypass \u2013 (see <a href="http://opinionatedmummy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Opinionated Mummy</a> and <a title="LIBERTY SCOTT" href="http://libertyscott.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Liberty Scott</a> for full and frightful details of <em>that</em>) \u2013 before grinding to a halt at the Otaki roundabout. <p>Levin lies a further 15 minutes north. From that point the worst is usually behind you and it\u2019s a decent run, weather/crashes permitting. Foolishly thinking that they might start to make progress, northbound motorists on SH1 last Friday evening faced a further hold-up at Levin\u2019s southern entrance. Adding insult to injury, four police cars \u2013 yes, four of them \u2013 were stationed with jovial officers checking for current warrants and registration. They were still happily doing this at 7pm and heaven only knows when they finished. I guess Bill English won\u2019t be grizzling about it, though. I bet he scored a nice little earner out of it. But then he probably wasn\u2019t stuck in that traffic jam, either.  <p>These would be the same cops who don\u2019t seem to patrol the town streets at night anymore and who don\u2019t seem to give a damn about property crime at all, let alone its effect upon victims. <p>Lord knows I struggle with the concept of tax at the best of times, but surely some decent policing is not too much to expect for what we\u2019re forced to continually hand over. There are countless stories like this one and it\u2019s not bloody good enough. The last government couldn\u2019t have given a continental about property crime (the glaring exception being the attack on Helen Clark\u2019s electoral office), so I\u2019d like to know what John Key\u2019s much vaunted \u201Cbroad church\u201D is going to do about it. <p>I\u2019m all ears, Judith Collins. <p align="center"><em>* * Susan Ryder is Libertarianz Sus, Read her column every Tuesday here at NOT PC * * </em></p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer">Content is copyright <a href="http://pc.blogspot.com">PC.BlogSpot.Com</a> ©  \u000APlease contact author for permission to republish: (organon at ihug.co.nz)<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/11906042-6583843517808112899?l=pc.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too many atheists are content to grant religionists of all brands a monopoly over what they call the 'spiritual.'&nbsp; \u201C</em><a title="Spiritual Or Not? - EXALTED MOMENTS" href="http://exaltedmoments.blogspot.com/2009/07/spiritual-or-not.html">We haven't any spiritual goals or qualities,\u201D <em>they say</em>, \u201CAll we care for is material things</a>.\u201D <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>And religionists are all too happy to let them believe that, since as long as they\u2019ve got a stranglehold on the things of \u2018the spirit\u2019 then they retain the important high ground -- and still have a toe-hold on intellectual respectability. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Ingersoll's writing is the perfect antidote to both religionists and materialists, which is is why I\u2019m reposting this piece on Ingersoll from </em><a title="THE RATIONAL CAPITALIST" href="http://dougreich.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Rational Capitalist</em></a><em> blog, where <a title="Sacred Scriptures of the Human Race - RATIONAL CAPITALIST" href="http://dougreich.blogspot.com/2009/10/sacred-scriptures-of-human-race.html" target="_blank">it first appeared</a>.&nbsp; (And if you\u2019re looking for commentary, analysis, and links upholding reason, individualism, and capitalism, you should add it to your regular reading list.)</em></p> <blockquote> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_G._Ingersoll">Robert G. Ingersoll </a>was part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Freethought">Free Thought</a> movement of the 19th century and an outspoken opponent of religion. In 1894, he wrote a brilliant piece titled <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/about_the_holy_bible.html"><em>About the Holy Bible</em></a> that not only provides a thorough expose of biblical contradiction but more importantly recognizes the fundamental conflict between religion and liberty, or, more specifically, between religion and man's happiness on earth. As the left, in addition to the right, <a href="http://dougreich.blogspot.com/2009/10/africas-big-brother-versus-masters-of.html">turns towards religion</a>, it is important to understand this conflict. The below excerpts represent a partial reprint of a previous <a href="http://dougreich.blogspot.com/2007/11/peikoff-and-ingersoll-religion-vs.html">post</a>, but I believe his writing is so outstanding I am posting this part again. I enjoy his writing more for its style than any technical philosophy (he was a famous orator) and his ability to articulate the essence of this conflict in such a passionate and eloquent way: </p> <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS of people who believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God -- millions who think that this book is staff and guide, counselor and consoler; that it fills the present with peace and the future with hope -- millions who believe that it is the fountain of law, Justice and mercy, and that to its wise and benign teachings the world is indebted for its liberty, wealth and civilization -- millions who imagine that this book is a revelation from the wisdom and love of God to the brain and heart of man -- millions who regard this book as a torch that conquers the darkness of death, and pours its radiance on another world -- a world without a tear. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They forget its ignorance and savagery, its hatred of liberty, its religious persecution; they remember heaven, but they forget the dungeon of eternal pain. They forget that it imprisons the brain and corrupts the heart. They forget that it is the enemy of intellectual freedom. Liberty is my religion. Liberty of hand and brain -- of thought and labor, liberty is a word hated by kings -- loathed by popes. It is a word that shatters thrones and altars -- that leaves the crowned without subjects, and the outstretched hand of superstition without alms. Liberty is the blossom and fruit of justice -- the perfume of mercy. Liberty is the seed and soil, the air and light, the dew and rain of progress, love and joy.</blockquote>In a section titled <em>Is Christ Our Example?</em>, Ingersoll writes:  <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HE NEVER SAID A word in favor of education. He never even hinted at the existence of any science. He never uttered a word in favor of industry, economy or of any effort to better our condition in this world. He was the enemy of the successful, of the wealthy. Dives was sent to hell, not because he was bad, but because he was rich. Lazarus went to heaven, not because he was good, but because he was poor. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ cared nothing for painting, for sculpture, for music -- nothing for any art. He said nothing about the duties of nation to nation, of king to subject; nothing about the rights of man; nothing about intellectual liberty or the freedom of speech. He said nothing about the sacredness of home; not one word for the fireside; not a word in favor of marriage, in honor of maternity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He never married. He wandered homeless from place to place with a few disciples. None of them seem to have been engaged in any useful business, and they seem to have lived on alms. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All human ties were held in contempt; this world was sacrificed for the next; all human effort was discouraged. God would support and protect. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last, in the dusk of death, Christ, finding that he was mistaken, cried out: "My God My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?" <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have found that man must depend on himself. He must clear the land; he must build the home; he must plow and plant; he must invent; he must work with hand and brain; he must overcome the difficulties and obstructions; he must conquer and enslave the forces of nature to the end that they may do the work of the world. </p></blockquote>Here is my favorite excerpt:  <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS men have been writing the real Bible, and it is being written from day to day, and it will never be finished while man has life. All the facts that we know, all the truly recorded events, all the discoveries and inventions, all the wonderful machines whose wheels and levers seem to think, all the poems, crystals from the brain, flowers from the heart, all the songs of love and joy, of smiles and tears, the great dramas of Imagination's world, the wondrous paintings, miracles of form and color, of light and shade, the marvelous marbles that seem to live and breathe, the secrets told by rock and star, by dust and flower, by rain and snow, by frost and flame, by winding stream and desert sand, by mountain range and billowed sea. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the wisdom that lengthens and ennobles life, all that avoids or cures disease, or conquers pain -- all just and perfect laws and rules that guide and shape our lives, all thoughts that feed the flames of love the music that transfigures, enraptures and enthralls the victories of heart and brain, the miracles that hands have wrought, the deft and cunning hands of those who worked for wife and child, the histories of noble deeds, of brave and useful men, of faithful loving wives, of quenchless mother-love, of conflicts for the right, of sufferings for the truth, of all the best that all the men and women of the world have said, and thought and done through all the years. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These treasures of the heart and brain -- these are the Sacred Scriptures of the human race. </p></blockquote></blockquote> <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SuN5dbyrMgI/AAAAAAAAITw/2He_as8qO9E/s1600-h/32.skyline7%5B6%5D.jpg"><img title="32.skyline7" border="0" alt="32.skyline7" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sd4aOA0Ur-I/SuN5gV7RHUI/AAAAAAAAIT0/JKoSEmeThZc/32.skyline7_thumb%5B4%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="582" height="434" /></a></p> <div class="blogger-post-footer">&nbsp;</div> <div class="blogger-post-footer">* By the way, in any rational sense \u201CSpirit\u201D and \u201CSpiritual\u201D <a title="Teleological Measurement - AYN RAND LEXICON" href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/teleological_measurement.html">have no meaning other than <em>'pertaining to consciousness.'</em></a></div> <div class="blogger-post-footer">&nbsp;</div> <div class="blogger-post-footer"><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Robert Ingersoll explains above why liberty is incompatible with mainstream religion.

VA senior Anglican Archbishop in England has said he is ready to convert to Catholicism, now that the Pope has opened the door for Anglicans to convert enmasse.<br /><blockquote>Bishop Hind <strong>said he would be "happy" to be reordained as a Catholic priest</strong> and said that <strong>divisions in Anglicanism could make it impossible to stay in the church</strong>.<br /><br />He is the most senior Anglican to admit that he is prepared to accept the offer from the Pope, who shocked the Church of England last week when he paved the way for clergy to convert to Catholicism in large numbers.<br /><br />In a further blow to the Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s hopes of preventing the Anglican Communion from <strong>disintegrating</strong>, <strong>other bishops have cast doubt over its survival</strong>.<br /><br />The Rt Rev John Broadhurst, <strong>the Bishop of Fulham, even claimed that "the Anglican experiment is over"</strong>. He said it has been shown to be powerless to cope with the crises over gays and women bishops.  <span><strong>[Because they caved in to the world.]</strong></span></blockquote><br />For more, with commentary in red, see Fr Z's blog at the link below.<br /><br />Related Link: <a href="http://wdtprs.com/blog/2009/10/the-anglican-experiment-is-over/">The Anglican Experiment is Over!</a> ~ WDTPRS<div class="blogger-post-footer">_______________\u000ANZ Conservative\u000AAll rights reserved and material copyright of their respective authors.<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/38893560-5138801194288870684?l=nzconservative.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<div><span><b>I was sent an intersting email today. Forget the global warming and get in an extra load of firewood!<br /><br /><br /><br />Subject:</b> To plan your summer for January,  it don't look good for the rest of the year, it a bit of reading but it's all  good<br /><br /></span></div><span>Returns of a Colder Sun</span>  <p><span><i>Wednesday 28th October 2009</i></span>  </p><p><span>Colourful Victorian writer Lady Barker, born Mary Anne Stewart  in Jamaica in 1830, lived in New Zealand, England, India, South Africa,  Mauritius, Australia and Trinidad. She married twice, had six sons, crossed the  Atlantic 15 times, survived cholera and earthquakes in Jamaica, and was almost  ship wrecked in the Indian Ocean. Lady Barker produced 18 books based on her  travels and experiences. Among them were \u201CStation Life in New Zealand\u201D (1870)  and its sequel \u201CStation Amusements in New Zealand\u201D (1873). Both books were based  on her three-year experience of living in New Zealand in the 1860s running  Steventon, a Canterbury sheep farm on the banks of the Selwyn River, with her  second husband Frederick Broome.</span>  </p><p><span>In "Station Life in NZ" Lady Barker describes in August 1867  \u201Csnow 6 to 9 feet deep in places, 90% of lambs lost, 4 days of very severe snow  falling, followed by massive flood.\u201D After that great 1867 snowstorm, through  which they lost 4,000 out of 7,000 sheep, Frederick sold his interest in  Steventon and returned with Lady Barker to England in December the following  year.</span>  </p><p><span>Travel forward 36 years now to 1903, and to another book, The  Cyclopedia of NZ. We read \u201CIn the winter of 1903 the weather at Arrowtown was of  a very severe type, and the temperature is said to have receded to a point 28  degrees below zero. This extreme cold resulted in the destruction of the whole  of the gum trees, and a considerable number of pine trees; a loss experienced  generally throughout the Lake district, where the ruin of so many groves of  handsome trees very much modified the picturesque ness, not only of Arrowtown,  but also of Queenstown, and the scenery on the roads in the district. In  Middlemarch the winter of 1903 will long be remembered as an exceptionally cold  season; the temperature registered at Middlemarch on the 17th of July of that  year was 13 degrees below zero.\u201D</span>  </p><p><span>In our time travel adventure let's jump forward another 36 years  to 1939. As described in Tephra Magazine, June 2003 \u201CProbably the worst storm in  NZ in the last hundred years occurred during winter of 1939 when snow fell the  length and breadth of the country from June through to August. On 31 July the  lighthouse keeper at Cape Maria van Dieman, at the top of the North Island,  reported snow falling at the lighthouse. A few days earlier it snowed in  Dargaville and snow lasted on the hills behind Kaikohe for several hours. In  Auckland, snow fell just before dawn 27 July sticking to clothes of people who  were about such as milkmen and policemen. 5cm of snow lay on the summit of Mt  Eden, Bombay Hills shone white most of the morning and in the Clevedon hills  snow lasted into the afternoon and numerous snowball fights took place between  people who had never seen snow before.\u201D</span>  </p><p><span>Come forward another 36 years. The New Zealand Journal of  Ecology 1; 81-83 states \u201CWinter 1974 was unusually wet, winter 1975 was the  coldest for many years and summer 1975-76 was wet and unusually cold\u201D. In the  previous year, a severe snowstorm in Canterbury and N Otago on 5 and 6 August  1973 had resulted in heavy losses of stock.</span>  </p><p><span>The next 36 years lands us in this year, and again an extra cold  winter. Why these 36-year jumps? Because 36 years is the Sun's Tide, or more  technically the repeatability of the same transit position of what astronomers  call the Solar System Barycentre. This means that if you take the orbits of the  planets of our solar system and average their centres of gravity to find out  their focus, you get a shifting point that swings from one Sun's radius beyond  the Sun across to one Sun's radius on the other side, crossing the centre of the  Sun every 36 years. This ebbing and flowing tide of extra and less  electromagnetism is regular.</span>  </p><p><span>The Moon, our nearest celestial neighbour, acting as one of the  cosmic planets orbiting the Sun, is tuned to this tide and in turn influences  weather events and tides on planet Earth as to a 36-38-year multiple,  determining the repeatability of seasons and tides every 18-19 years and of  droughts every 9 years. Divide that in two and we find that the Southern  Oscillation Index which is close to a 4.5-yr cycle. It is now becoming widely  accepted that the SOI leads to El Nino/La Nina conditions that in turn drive  ocean temperatures, wind directions and climate fluctuations.</span>  </p><p><span>Because of the SSB it is easy to plot 36-38 yearly repeats of  severe weather events. There are plenty of good examples if we choose to look  for them. The 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita could have been the return of  either 1965\u2019s Hurricane Betsy and/or 1969's Hurricane Camille, the worst  calamities that far recorded on the Eastern Seabord, and Camille in turn was the  most significant event there since the 1933 Chesapeake Bay Disaster, each a  36-yr jump. In this part of the world 2006's Cyclone Larry was 36 years after  1970's Cyclone Ada, and 2006's Cyclone Monica was 18 years (half of 36) after  1988's Cyclone Bola. In 2006 a severe Canterbury winter cold snap was possibly  the revisiting of the remarkably similar 1969 winter cold snap. In 2004 the  world witnessed the Asian tsunami quake. It was the biggest in the area for 36  years. In 1968 a huge earthquake had registered 8.3mag near Sumatra.</span>  </p><p><span>Perhaps then, this does not bode well for winter of 2010, which  looks rather frighteningly like the winter of 1939 returning. Temperatures in  the world are always tied to solar activity. Without solar radiation, which  means heat from the Sun, the ground is not warmed. If the ground is not warmed  then neither is the air above the ground, which only gets its heat from the  ground below. The air cannot warm itself, and nothing in the air can warm itself  (which rules out carbon dioxide) anymore than traces of impurity floating about  in the sea can raise ocean temperatures. Without warmth coming from the Sun  there is less evaporation, which means less likelihood of rain in the warmer  seasons.</span>  </p><p><span>For the first half of next year a drought is on the cards for N  Otago. Was there a drought 36 years ago in 1974? Many Canterbury farmers will  recall that there was. How about 36 years back to 1939? The New Zealand record  for a dry period still belongs to Marlborough and their 71-day dry period  finishing on 19 April 1939.  In 1939 the sunspot count was much less than that  of warmer years like 1982, 1988, 1990-1991 and 1999-2000.  The 1939 sunspot  number was about a third less than for 1938, which some have already compared to  2009.</span>  </p><p><span>Because we are not gods we cannot guarantee future outcomes. We  imagine what makes us human might be a special ability to remember, recognize  patterns and use them to predict. Accordingly we collect stories of our own  experiences and we are avid readers of the lives and adventures of others. From  historical accounts comes an awareness of cycles. North Otago is facing a  6-month drought, with relief rains not due til next June/July. Canterbury may be  into sub 5deg minimums in the middle of next February; an early descent into  autumn. In some parts of the country March southwesterlies may make it the  coldest March in 50 years. April may be the coldest April in half a century. In  May unusual cold might burn kiwifruit vines, and hail and snow do damage to  kiwifruit orchards. June brings severe frosts in Central Otago. August may see  exceptional snow storms and squalls. In September Christchurch may experience  the heaviest snowfall since 1945, with maximums perhaps up to 10deg below  normal.  October\u2019s unusual cold means spring is slow to start. Thousands of  recently shorn sheep in Hawkes Bay and Manawatu may die from cold. January 2011  could be bringing cool, cloudy and wet weather, especially to the east coast.   It might not be a bad idea to prepare ourselves for next year when and if Lady  Barker\u2019s winter revisits.</span><span><br /></span></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14299289-2908938825612196974?l=oswaldbastable.blogspot.com" /></div>

I am something of a political biography junkie,  and I think 'His Way' - the biography of Sir Robert Muldoon - is the best local political bio I have read.</div><div><br /></div><div>I do think Gustafson is a little too gentle on Muldoon.  But that is a matter of interpretation.  One soon learns, in reading about politics, to skirt past a writer's own interpretation and concentrate on the raw information being presented.</div><div><br /></div><div>And there is plenty of that in 'His Way'. The stories of the internal machinations of National's caucus, from the mid-to-late 1960s, though to Muldoon's demise in 1984, include a lot of previously unavailable information. </div><div><br /></div><div>The only other quibble - and this probably reflects my own pre-occupations - is Gustafson does not put quite as much emphasis on economic issues as I would like. </div><div><br /></div><div>Muldoon came and spoke at an Auckland University Political Studies class, of which I was a member,  in 1989 and was asked what his biggest mistake was.</div><div><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_S57sX5HxwcY/SuYeX3taxxI/AAAAAAAAAK0/VtnRn_w5smU/s400/gustafson+on+holyoake.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5397034598890391314" /></div><div>He said he thought his biggest error was not realising the economic downturn New Zealand found ourselves in from the late 1960s was a major economic shift. They assumed it was simply another cyclical downturn, and reacted accordingly - i.e. with Keynsian pump-priming. </div><div><br /></div><div>Gustafson - who, from memory, co-ordinated that university course - was in the middle of interviewing Muldoon at the time and similar comments are included. </div><div><br /></div><div>There is an overlap with the Holyoake book.  Muldoon was very much Holyoake's apprentice and the period 1966-75 was, in different ways, a vital part of both men's lives. </div><div><br /></div><div>The most intriguing earlier part of the Holyoake book is the demonstration of how distrusted Holyoake was by National's more business-oriented wing.  There was a concerted bid to get dump Holyoake when National was in opposition between 1957-60, a move driven by Auckland business.  The book shows National's business wing was never very happy with Holyoake. </div><div><br /></div><div>Again, it is intriguing how Labour's internal politics was much written about from the 1950s through to the present day, but National's were completely unrecorded, until these books.  </div><div><br /></div><div>In their different ways, they show a very different New Zealand to the one we live in now. </div><div><br /></div><div>Holyoake was notoriously heavy-footed when he got behind the wheel of a car and collected a number of speeding tickets.  There is an incident where the then Transport Minsiter, Peter Gordon, marched into Holyoake's office with a wad of tickets, ripped them up in front of Holyoake and told him to ease up on the accelerator pedal.  </div><div><br /></div><div>No PM today would get away with that without it being made public.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then again, Holyoake was incredibly stingy when it came to spending on his own or his ministers' comforts.  He refused to commission what became the Beehive, and the curtains in his office were literally rotting because he refused to have them replaced.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is also a nice comment about Holyoake's greatest hardship when he became governor-general - the long lunches.  Since growing up on a farm he'd taken the attitude that lunch took seven minutes, maximum, to eat, before getting back to work.  He'd taken the same approach as PM, apparently.  </div><div><br /></div><div>For anyone with an interest in New Zealand politics, these books are essential reading.  And Gustafson deserves a knighthood, in my opinion, for his work. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15248435-4416186312542454595?l=hosking.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>The Government showed itself embarrassingly insecure about socio-economic inequality in New Zealand today by refusing leave in the House to table graphs from a recent book called <em>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</em> by British researchers Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.</p>\u000A<p>Green MP Kennedy Graham asked the Prime Minister if he was concerned that the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2009/">UNDP\u2019s <em>Human Development Report 2009</em></a> shows NZ to be among the most unequal countries in the developed world. The Government transferred the question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but it was actually answered by Attorney General Chris Finlayson on behalf of the perpetually-absent Minister.</p>\u000A<p>The \u2018Minister\u2019 claimed he had not seen the report, and continued to give that answer to subsequent questions (you can read a transcript of the questions in <a href="http://blog.greens.org.nz/2009/10/27/government-asleep-at-the-wheel-on-inequality/">frog's earlier post</a>). However this doesn't wash, since he and his officials had been notified some five hours before question time to find this well-publicised, three-week-old report and have a quick look at it.</p>\u000A<p>Kennedy's supplementary questions focussed on the research findings in <em>The Spirit Level</em>, which clearly documents the close correlation between negative social indicators \u2013 health, mental health, life expectancy, violence, imprisonment, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy and more \u2013 and inequality. </p>\u000A<p>This is the most important book I have read this year (along with Tim Jackson\u2019s Prosperity Without Growth, just launched this week, but that is another blog). It graphs income disparity in a range of OECD countries against their national statistics on all these social indicators and shows a very good fit (although not perfect, and closer for some indicators than others).</p>\u000A<p>It goes on to discuss the reasons \u2013 people in a very unequal society are highly stressed by trying to either preserve their place in the social hierarchy, or improve it. The interesting thing is that these negative social indicators apply to the richest in those unequal societies, as well as the poor. New Zealand scores poorly on most of these indicators, as do the US, UK and Portugal, while Japan and the Nordic countries score relatively much better. </p>\u000A<p>Anyway, when Kennedy sought the leave of the House to table three particular pages of the book, National denied leave. That is an unusual thing to do. It usually occurs when people are using the tabling procedure to score political points, and the Speaker has tightened up recently on tabling documents that the House already has easy access to. This was not such a case. It is a new book, not before the House, and most people will not have heard of it. Obviously the Nats have heard of it, and realise how dangerous it would be for their political agenda if it became widely known. They would no longer, for example, be able to grandstand about crime and violence if it could be shown to be exacerbated by the rich-poor gap which Labour did little to reduce and which they are widening. </p>\u000A<p>Ironically, the act of refusing leave to table it might be the very thing that brings it to public notice. It certainly prompted this blog.</p>\u000A<p>You can read more about <em>The Spirit Level</em> and inequality research <a href="http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/">here</a>.</p>

Poor show, chaps.</p>\u000A<p>[UPDATE: Transcript below]</p>\u000A<p>5. Dr KENNEDY GRAHAM (Green) to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: Has he received advice on the UN Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Report2009; and is he concerned that it positions New Zealand as having the sixth-biggest gap between rich and poor among countries with very high human development, with a similar inequality score to India and Russia?</p>\u000A<p>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Attorney-General) on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs: No. The Minister is advised that NZAID, Treasury, and the Ministry of Social Development have not yet seen the report, and the Government cannot comment about the content of a report it has not received. However, I can advise the member that an electronic version of the executive summary, which was sent in advance of the report\u2019s release, has been received. I understand that this summary says nothing about the inequality scores the member referred to in his question.</p>\u000A<p>Dr Kennedy Graham: Given that this report has been completely available for the past week, has Cabinet discussed the findings of British researchers Wilkinson and Pickett that \u201CAlmost every modern social and environmental problem\u2014ill-health, lack of community life, violence, drugs, obesity, mental illness, long working hours, big prison populations\u2014is more likely to occur in a less equal society.\u201D?</p>\u000A<p>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON: No.</p>\u000A<p>Dr Kennedy Graham: Is he concerned that the same research shows that violence is higher and more people are imprisoned in more unequal countries; if so, what is his Government doing to improve New Zealand\u2019s inequality ranking from that reported by the United Nations Development Programme?</p>\u000A<p>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON: The Government would need to study the report in detail before it could comment on the methodology used or the reliability of the data. I understand that methodology and data are often contentious aspects of such reports.</p>\u000A<p>Dr Kennedy Graham: Given that the methodology of the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Report is now 17 years old, and that this particular ranking is taken from the Gini coefficient ratio, which is well known to researchers and policy makers, is he concerned that more people suffer from mental illness in more unequal countries; if so, what is his Government doing to improve New Zealand\u2019s inequality ranking from that recorded by the United Nations Development Programme?</p>\u000A<p>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON: The Minister cannot be concerned or unconcerned until the report has been read and the methodology data has been studied.</p>\u000A<p>Dr Kennedy Graham: Working on the assumption that the report will no doubt be read by the Government in due course, at its leisure, is his Government\u2019s policy of tax cuts for the rich and cutting weekly accident compensation entitlements for casual and seasonal workers likely to increase or decrease inequality in New Zealand?</p>\u000A<p>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON: I can assure the member that when the report is received it will be read.</p>

First, we have all those areas that are national parks: areas such as the Abel Tasman National Park, and the national parks of Arthur's Pass, Egmont, Fiordland, Kahurangi, Mount Aspiring, Mount Cook, Nelson Lakes, Paparoa, Tongariro, Te Urewera, Westland, and Whanganui.

Areas around New Zealand have been set aside as nature reserves, scientific reserves, wilderness areas, sanctuaries, and wildlife sanctuaries. There are areas that have been set aside as Ramsar sites, in terms of the convention on wetlands and highly migratory birds, as well as those areas in the Coromandel that the Alliance member Jeanette Fitzsimons has mentioned.

NICK SMITH (Minister of  Conservation): In rising to support the third reading of the Bill, I draw the  House's attention to the significance of the final stages of the passage of this  legislation. The role of mining in New Zealand has been a controversial  issue right from the last century, when mining was given preferred status as a  land use. In fact, if we look at the history in the West Coast, Otago, or Nelson  regions, we see that miners were put on a pedestal. Rights of access to land  would be given to them over and above rights being given to other persons. </span></span></div>\u000A<div dir="ltr">\u000A<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Over  the last decade we have seen a number of pieces of significant legislation that  effectively bring mining activities into line with other land uses, be they  tourism, farming, or other sorts of land use. In 1991 we saw the passage of the  Crown Minerals Act. That was landmark legislation, in that it stated at long  last that miners could not walk on to private property and trample all over  those private property owners' rights. They had to get the consent of the  landowners. </span></p>\u000A<p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, at that time the  issue of conservation land, which makes up about one-third of the land of New Zealand, was left in abeyance. This  Bill at long last puts some pegs in the sand in some very significant areas of  New Zealand and says to the mining industries of New Zealand: "These are no-go  areas." </span></p>\u000A<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I draw  the House's attention this afternoon to just how significant that range of areas  is.

NICK SMITH: Yes, and I have to say that the commitment that was made in 1990 to  ban mining in national parks was a significant one. While the member Judith  Tizard may chuckle away, I have to say that in 6 years of Labour Administration  no move was made on this issue. That is partly, as I am sure she will  acknowledge, because there are substantial interests that the member for the  West Coast would have about ecological areas. It has been a highly contentious  issue in the select committee as to which areas and classifications of land  would be included in this mining ban and which would not. What is more, the Bill  does provide a mechanism, which has been improved in the Committee stage,  whereby additional areas can be added to those that will be provided for in the  mining ban. </span></p>\u000A<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I also  wish to make comment about my New Zealand First colleagues and their attitude to  this Bill.

I specifically want to mention  Christine Fletcher, from National, who has had particular passions about the  area of Coromandel, as has the Labour member Judith Tizard. I also want to  mention the previous Minister of Energy, Doug Kidd, who was very much involved  in the brokering of this legislation and in finding the way through the  different areas, and in deciding how they might be treated. </span></p>\u000A<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This  is landmark legislation for the conservation movement in New Zealand.

VThe Ministry of Social Development has silently released its annual Social Report for 2009 \u2013 no doubt attempting to keep the findings under the radar. Likewise, the National Government has refrained from releasing a single press release on it (as yet). As always with the wealth of statistics in such reports, there is the good and the bad to be seized upon, and these things can be spun by the left and the right, and the various partisans in many different ways. I\u2019ll leave Labour and National to give the positive spin on the current stats \u2013 and much of the negative material reflects poorly on the past Labour Government, for which the period of this report effectively covers. Instead, this blog post highlight some of the negative material that immediately sticks out from a browse of the report. There is one particular domain within the report that shows serious problems: \u2018Economic Standard of Living\u2019. Basically, since the last annual report \u2013 and thus during Labour\u2019s last year in office \u2013 New Zealand became a less equal society, with increased inequality and greater poverty.

V<p>So, the day after <a href="http://www.labourday.org.nz/">Labour Day</a>, the government introduces legislation to <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0910/S00393.htm">steal your meal and rest breaks</a>.  Talk about giving the finger to the labour movement.\u000A\u000A<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2009/0091/latest/whole.html#dlm2440327">bill</a> will replace the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0024/latest/DLM1940671.html#DLM1940671">existing statutory rights to meal and rest breaks</a> with a vague requirement for "reasonable" and "appropriate" breaks which may in fact require the employee to continue working, are taken at the time specified by the employer, and which may not in fact be provided <i>at all</i> if "compensatory measures" (such as a later start time, an earlier finish time or accumulated time off) are provided.  Given that the length of the work day is purely nominal and that such time off may be unpaid, the result is to remove the right entirely.\u000A\u000A<p>And that's National's approach to employment relations in a nutshell: turning enforceable rights into grace and favour which we must beg for, like a peasant to a lord.  And while it will make no difference in most workplaces, the workplaces where it <i>is</i> necessary - where employees are denied the basic dignities of not feeling hungry or thirsty or not having to piss themselves while working - will have just got themselves an abuser's charter.  By changing the law, national is explicitly supporting these abusive employers.\u000A\u000A<p>The bill was, according to the explanatory note, "developed at speed and without significant consultation".  And it will be passed under urgency.  The Regulatory Impact Statement (such as it is - this is another bill which bypassed the normal requirements) notes that it is expected to become law by the end of the year, meaning no real time for select committee consideration.  That is assuming they don't ram it through without a select committee stage at all to get it in by 1 November to avoid having to negotiate properly with regional air traffic controllers.  But that just seems to be the way this government operates: legislate in haste, and leave us to repent at leisure.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-8630127152829255619?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p><i>Carbon News</i> this morning reports that the government's pollution subsidies to the Tiwai Point Aluminium smelter sum to an enormous $209 million - or <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0910/S00381.htm">$225,000 per job</a> (more than an MP's slary) for each of the 930 workers the smelter employs.  It's a massive indictment of the subsidy scheme.  Or is it?\u000A\u000A<p>Delving into the figures, it seems they are based on not just the direct subsidy to Rio Tinto, but also the opportunity cost of their exclusive use of the power from Manapouri - power that could instead be used elsewhere, allowing the dirty inefficient coal-fired Huntly Power Station to be closed down.  And unfortunately, the latter massively outweighs the former:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>Replacing the emissions-intensive Huntly with Manapouri would result in a net decrease in liabilities to taxpay¬ers of $209 million per annum, made up of the non-payment of the Rio Tinto subsidy ($14 million) and the non-payment of the Huntly subsidy ($195 million),\u201D he said.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000AThis is I think an unfair loading of costs when we're talking about a per-job subsidy.  Besides, its not as if $15,000 per job in direct subsidies for Tiwai Point's emissions is anything to be sneezed at. So on that front I think <i>Carbon News</i> massively overstates the case.  But they have made a very good argument for shutting down Tiwai Point entirely.  After all, Rio Tinto's own figures show a maximum annual benefit to New Zealand of <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2008/05/climate-change-hoisting-rio-tinto-with.html">$121.2 million per year</a>.  With current carbon costs of $209 million per year - and it <i>is</i> fair to count the opportunity cost of running Huntly when we're looking at an overall cost-benefit analysis - we're looking at being at least $88 million a year better off if we close the place down, which increases to $100 million once you remove the "benefit" of deferred grid upgrades (which we are already paying).  This rises to over $300 million a year post-2012 when carbon prices are expected to be higher and Tiwai Point's output lower.\u000A\u000A<p>What this shows us is that Rio Tinto are just leeches.  Once the environmental costs are counted, their presence makes us actively worse-off as a society, and significantly so.  We should not be paying these people pollution subsidies; instead we should be shutting them down.  And the sooner that happens, the better off we will be.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-1594234172642257780?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>One new addition to the <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/">Social Report</a> this year is a section on <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/civil-political-rights/representation-ethnic-groups-government.html">representation of ethnic groups in government</a>.  The graph speaks for itself about what MMP has meant for ethnic representation:\u000A\u000A<p><b>Members of Parliament identifying as M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples or Asian 1984\u20132008, and M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples or Asian share of the total population</b><br />\u000A<img src="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/images/sr/cp3-1.gif" />\u000A\u000A<p>The bars are percentages of MPs, the dots (taken from census data) are percentages of the population.  So, we have a way to go yet, but MMP has still resulted in a massive improvement and given us a Parliament that looks a lot more like New Zealand.  That will likely disappear if the electoral system is changed - a tremendous loss to the legitimacy of our political system, and to New Zealand.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-3060198936613714148?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>The <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/">2009 Social Report</a> has finally been released. Normally it would have come out by August, but this year was unaccountably delayed, Cabinet not signing off on it until last week.  I guess they just didn't view it as a priority.  Unfortunately, it has also fallen victim to some extent to the government's drive to cut costs, so instead of it being published as a hardcopy (and available for future researchers in libraries), it is now a web-only publication.  Which is so much more fragile.  Important government data like this should not be published only in a digital medium.  \u000A\u000A<p>Most of the data in this report dates from 2006-2008, so its Labour's legacy that is being reported on: lower (though now rising again) <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/economic-standard-living/income-inequality.html">income inequality</a>, increased <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/paid-work/median-hourly-earnings.html">median hourly earnings</a>, and the stubborn persistence of ethnic gaps in <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/life-expectancy.html">life expectancy</a>.  It also shows the consequences of their education policies, with decreased <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/knowledge-skills/participation-tertiary-education.html">participation in tertiary education</a> (particularly among M\u0101ori and Pacific Peoples) thanks to their racist stomping on the w\u0101nanga.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/economic-standard-living/housing-affordability.html">housing unaffordability</a> is at an all time high, with a flow-on effect on <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/economic-standard-living/population-low-incomes.html">child poverty</a> which has unravelled all the good work done by Working For Families.  But you won't read any of this in the <a href="http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/newsroom/media-releases/news/2009/social-report-fact-sheet-2009.doc">key findings</a>: their focus is relentlessly long-term, concentrating on improvements since the 80's and 90's rather than recent (and politically attributable) changes.\u000A\u000A<p>Next year's report - if it happens - will begin to show the effects of National's policies.  Unfortunately, the 2009 data in this one on <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/paid-work/unemployment.html">unemployment</a>, <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/paid-work/employment.html">employment participation</a> and <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/economic-standard-living/market-income-person.html">incomes</a> is not good.  In their first year, the standard of living of the average New Zealander has dropped.  While they're not responsible for the recession, they are responsible for dealing with it and reducing the impact on New Zealanders - and by these statistics, their reaction has so far been a failure.\u000A\u000A<p>You can download the full report <a href="http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/documents/social-report-2009.pdf">here</a> [PDF].<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-2842001416150800852?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>When the government first floated plans to use <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10580279">double bunking</a> to overcrowd prisons, criminologists warned that it would lead to <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10560955">rapes, bullying and violence</a>.  And now we can add <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch/2987910/Fear-of-attacker-prompted-prison-suicide-sources">suicide</a> to that list:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>A prisoner, who had been raped by another inmate, killed himself after learning his attacker was being brought back to the same prison, prison sources say.\u000A\u000A<p>The Corrections Department says an independent review into Michael Graham Maxwell's death means it cannot comment.\u000A\u000A<p>[...]\u000A\u000A<p>Maxwell's funeral was held on Tuesday in Hoon Hay.\u000A\u000A<p>He died in Christchurch Hospital on Friday after being found in his Christchurch Men's Prison cell on October 10.\u000A\u000A<p>Maxwell was repeatedly raped in Christchurch Men's Prison in 2005, after being placed in the same cell as Noble, a violent gang member.\u000A\u000A<p>A prison source said Maxwell, 24, committed suicide after other inmates taunted him that Noble was being brought back to the prison.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000AThere's more in today's papers about how Maxwell had <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10605586">sought help</a> - including ACC counselling - for psychological issues caused by his rape, and how he had <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3000699/Man-raped-in-prison-pleaded-with-PM-for-help">pleaded with the Prime Minister</a> to be allowed into a proper rehabilitation programme.  Those pleas were ignored.  As a result, a man is dead.\u000A\u000A<p>No doubt the Sensible Sentencing Trust will soon issue a press release saying "good riddance", but there are two points we should remember.  Firstly, the protection of the law extends to everyone, even to convicted criminals; that is what differentiates the state from a gang.  There has been a clear failure in their duty of car eon the part of Corrections which has led directly to a man's death, and they need to be held accountable for it.  Secondly, despite the Sensible Sentencing Trust's <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2009/09/dropping-mask.html">urgent fantasies</a>, we do not have the death penalty in New Zealand.  At least, not in law.  But double bunking will give us one <i>de facto</i>.  And that is simply unacceptable in a civilised society.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-2537208692853821383?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>Last week we learned that Local Government Minister Rodney Hide was <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2009/10/perk-of-office.html">treating his job as a corrupt little fiefdom</a>, giving speeches within his portfolio and charging stakeholders a donation to the ACT party if they wanted to hear them in <a href="http://www.cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/2.50#2.52">clear contravention of Ministerial guidelines</a>.  That's bad enough, but the response to an urgent OIA request has added insult to injury - we're paying for his travel as well:\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<i>On Wednesday 4 November, Mr Hide will be in Christchurch on business related to his Ministerial portfolios of Local Government and Regulatory Reform. The purpose of this trip is to deliver a keynote address to the Canterbury Manufacturers Association on the principles behind his Regulatory Reform programme. While he is in Christchurch he will also be making site visits to a local engineering firm and the University of Canterbury. Mr Hide will also be meeting with members of the press and conducting other Ministerial duties.\u000A\u000A<p>There will be no additional costs to Vote: Ministerial Services related to Mr Hide's address to the ACT Party at the Heartland Cotswald Hotel.</i>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A\u000ASure, there's no additional costs to the taxpayer, and it is of course all within the rules, but it is an unacceptable mingling of public and private business.  Thanks to some clever scheduling, we're effectively footing the bill for Hide's attendance at his little fundraiser.  And we simply shouldn't be.  The Ministerial travel budget is to pay for travel as part of Ministerial duties - not for Ministers to zip around the country touching up donors for cash.\u000A\u000A<p>More generally, Ministers need to be able to maintain a rigid separation between their public duties and their private business.  But like some feudal lord, Hide seems unable to tell the difference.  If he cannot distinguish between the two, then he is simply unfit to be a Minister.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-64111663657934582?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>By <a href="http://www.labourday.org.nz/">Stephen Day</a>\u000A\u000A<p>I've always thought that there is something counterintuitive about unionists organising activity around Labour Day. Labour Day has come to mean, for most New Zealanders, a day off because, well, we deserve to have a day off. It's nice to have a place in our year dedicated to not needing to do anything, just taking a break.\u000A\u000A<p>Sure, during our early Labour Days we had big festivals, parades and sporting occasions. But these days Labour Day can quite happily be about little more than sleeping in, hopefully sitting about in the sun and maybe spending more time than you might usually with friends or family.\u000A\u000A<p>This year hasn't been the best one for workers and union members. Most employers, including the biggest employer of them all, the one we elect, have responded to the global recession by zipping up their wallet and bunkering down. It's tough times for employers as well as workers. On the whole workers, through their unions, have tried to work cooperatively with their employers within these new financial constraints. However some employers, who haven't faced tough times, who are in fact continuing to make large profits, are exploiting the situation to batter their workers and generate more profits. Many workers are still after all theses years still not getting paid enough to look after a family and live a decent life.  Many face working conditions that are unnecessarily harsh, lacking in respect or dignity, or even downright dangerous. \u000A\u000A<p>But despite all that there are still things to celebrate.  We now have paid parental leave.  We have legislated meal breaks, breastfeeding breaks, four weeks annual leave and regular increases to the minimum wage.  We achieved all these things in the recent past.  We achieved all theses things by working together and campaigning for them.\u000A\u000A<p>Not everyone will get a holiday on Monday but most will, and another recent victory by working people and our unions means that those who don't still get a day in lieu.\u000A\u000A<p>My advice is don't spend Monday thinking about unions and working conditions.  It's a holiday so enjoy it doing stuff you want to do.  But the next day, Tuesday, go to say hello to the union delegate at your worksite and ask if there is anything simple you can do to help to win the next small improvement for workers and our families.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5054264-5923767424441813926?l=norightturn.blogspot.com" /></div>

Demolished it I believe. But the article doesn't mention that history at all - and since I can't find any references on the internet I guess it's just an unproven assertion on my part, but I'm sure there was a small station building and platform just down from the depot that they are talking about.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.aucklandtrains.co.nz/2009/10/20/plan-for-historic-parnell-train-station-gathers-steam/">Pictures</a> of Parnell site. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.aucklandtrains.co.nz/2009/10/24/next-step-along-long-track-to-electrification/">Auckland Trains blog</a> has some photos of the electrification preparation. Not that I think it will be delivered as long as the structure and funding is deliberately hamstrung by Wellington, but works are clearly underway.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Yu6lJst3lkM/SuY0mPoUcVI/AAAAAAAAFhc/ObM3ta96mLY/s1600-h/Picture+7.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Yu6lJst3lkM/SuY0mPoUcVI/AAAAAAAAFhc/ObM3ta96mLY/s400/Picture+7.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5397059035085435218" /></a>And this is where Auckland puts on the dunce cap once again. It's all in aid of an over-head system. <br /><br />Why? Why does the electrification have to be over-head? Why do ugly over-head wires and gantries etc. have to be erected?<br /><br />Because no-one has contemplated the alternative of a third rail/track electrification system? No rolling stock has been purchased - there's never been any real funding commitment - and yet the presumption is it should be above ground and not at ground level. Why? <br /><br />Because of the level crossings? Because they are too slack to fence off the lines? We have an opportunity to do it right, but just watch them do it all wrong - and spends untold millions in the process. The one advantage Auckland does have - that things aren't set in concrete and are undeveloped will be pissed away. Just watch.<br /><br />In the year 2099 when electrification does arrive it will be accompanied by an unnecessary  mess of wires above the tracks - that's where this is going. If the reason for going over-head is because it's faster and cheaper we should realise that it never pans out that way. Same thing with the horrible cane plantation-type narrow gauge - we'll stick with that even if it turns out we could have replaced a majority of that through the current upgrade process anyway. Hopeless.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12465152-1559994140693709083?l=tumeke.blogspot.com" /></div>

Michael Graham Maxwell, 24, was later transferred to the Kia Marama programme for child-sex offenders at Rolleston Prison. Lawyer Shannon-Leigh Litt said Maxwell felt "sexualised" by other members of the Kia Marama programme, and she questioned the wisdom of placing a rape victim with rapists and sex offenders. Maxwell died in Christchurch Hospital on October 16 after being found in his Christchurch Men's Prison cell on October 10. Maxwell was repeatedly raped in 2005 by cellmate Dean Noble.</i><br /><br />Wow, I mean, wow.

Now I know there will be some, and I\u2019m sure we will hear from them, who will scream do the crime do the time \u2013 but beyond the sensible sentencing death penalty fantacists this horrific story of desperate suicide within a corrupt, broken and underfunded prison system that Simon Power who has done more than any other politician to pretend  is some sort of adult Disneyland, intends to \u2018solve\u2019 by privatizing our prison services to the evil corporate prison industry. <br /><br />GEO, the private prison conglomerate, spoke at the select committee hearing earlier this year and to the deep tears from some of our anonymous right wing on line mafia pointed out that private prisons would not be cheaper than Public \u2013 NOT BE CHEAPER RIGHT WING ON LINE MAFIA \u2013 say it ain\u2019t so kittens, say it ain\u2019t so. <br /><br />We are building an empire of suffering whose septic poison will slowly seep back into society.

"We're not about going around bashing up Polynesians or Asians."<br /><br />If a European youth was found vandalising property: "We'd probably say `Hey, what are you doing? That's not really the white way'."</i><br /><br />The W in recession will cause a massive global retraction and possible repeat of the kind of social malaise  the Great Depression caused. When those intense economic conditions kill off people\u2019s belief in democratic capitalism, they turn to other forms of legitimiacy. We saw the rise of facism and communism in the 30s due in part to the crushing impact of crippling economic conditions. <br /><br />At 1pm on October 24th 1929, the vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Whitney marched onto the stock exchange floor after a morning of devastating losses and purchased well over the sale price in front of everyone $20million dollars worth of US. Steel stock. He then went on to purchase General Electric, AT&T; and other blue chip stocks spending $130million. His move funded by the wealthiest elites at the time was an attempt to insert confidence into a financial system on the verge of collapse. It worked. Until Monday 28th of October, four days later.<br /><br />Ben Bernanke is a modern day Richard Whitney, the second the stimulus money dries up, the economy will crash again, or the economy will crash due to the immense stress from printing all that cash, the writing is on the wall and everyone seems to be in some type of delusion about it. What interests me is where the pressure will blow inside communities. Globalization protestors and environmental protestors will be one pressure point that will get increasingly radical as their middle class knowledge base gets angrier and angrier, but that\u2019s the educated. Those not so bright will rush to the old scars, look at the rise of the BNP and the NZ connections on the BNP politician list, a couple of quiet unassuming NZers living here in NZ are fascist racists (that\u2019s my polite term for the BNP).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10604670">Three Kiwis on far-right party's list</a> <br /> <i>A detailed membership list for the far-right British National Party has been leaked, revealing that the white supremacist party's influence reaches as far as New Zealand. The list, which contains 16,000 names, many with contact details, was published on the website Wikileaks. Three New Zealanders appeared on the list.</i><br /><br />We can see how the Government is preparing for the social malaise from economic collapse: vast new surveillance powers not just for the Police BUT MOST STATE DEPARTMENTS, the ability to take your DNA on mere arrest, the increasing prison population, the need to privatize it to keep feeding people into prison, the streamlining of the Court system so that you are judged and sentenced via remote, the broadening of what can de defined as \u2018a gang\u2019 (it\u2019s 3 people) which then triggers surveillance powers and the ability to seize and freeze your assets.<br /><br />The challenge for liberal progressives will be to fight these events on all fronts to protect the civil rights and freedoms we have fought so long and hard for. That fight gets harder and harder as economic uncertainty caused by unregulated casino shock capitalism decimates communities. This period of pause is merely the time delay between the earthquake and the tsunami about to hit us.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/12465152-6395581057575267478?l=tumeke.blogspot.com" /></div>

Bush presidency, which might have remotely justified the granting of the Nobel Prize to Obama. In fact quite the opposite. The Obama military agenda has sought to extend the war into new frontiers. With a new team of military and foreign policy advisers, the Obama war agenda has been far more effective in fostering military escalation than that formulated by the NeoCons.</p>\u000A<p align="justify">Since the very outset of the Obama presidency, this global military project has become increasingly pervasive, with the reinforcement of US military presence in all major regions of the World  and the development of new advanced weapons systems on an unprecdented scale.</p>\u000A<p>Granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama provides legitimacy to the illegal practices of war, to the military occupation of foreign lands, to the relentless killings of civilians in the name of "democracy".</p>\u000A<p align="justify"><img src="http://agabus.com/wp-content/uploads/obama-peace-prize-agabus.jpg" alt="http://agabus.com/wp-content/uploads/obama-peace-prize-agabus.jpg" width="700" height="407" /></p>\u000A<p align="justify">\u000A<p align="justify"><em>[ " ... decision stuns many because he took office less than two weeks before nomination deadline " ...  ]</em></p>\u000A<blockquote>\u000A<p align="justify">\u000A</blockquote>\u000A<p>Both the Obama administration and NATO are directly threatening Russia, China and Iran. The US under Obama is developing "a First Strike Global Missile Shield System":</p>\u000A<p>"Along with space-based weapons, the Airborne Laser is the next defense frontier. ... Never has Ronald Reagan's dream of layered missile defenses - Star Wars, for short - been as....close, at least technologically, to becoming realized."</p>\u000A<p>Reacting to this consolidation, streamlining and upgrading of American global nuclear strike potential, on August 11 the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, the same Alexander Zelin cited earlier on the threat of U.S. strikes from space on all of his nation, said that the "Russian Air Force is preparing to meet the threats resulting from the creation of the Global Strike Command in the U.S. Air Force" and that Russia is developing "appropriate systems to meet the threats that may arise." (Rick Rozoff, Showdown with Russia and China: U.S. Advances First Strike Global Missile Shield System, Global Research, August 19, 2009)</p>\u000A<p>At no time since the Cuban missile crisis has the World been closer to the unthinkable: a World War III scenario, a global military conflict involving the use of nuclear weapons.</p>\u000A<p>1. The so-called missile defense shield or Star Wars initiative involving the first strike use of nuclear weapons is now to be developed globally in different regions of the World. The missile shield is largely directed against Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.</p>\u000A<p>2. New US military bases have been set up with a view to establishing US spheres of influence in every region of the World as well as surrounding and confronting Russia and China.</p>\u000A<p>3. There has been an escalation in the Central Asian Middle East war. The "defense budget" under Obama has spiraled with increased allocations to both Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>\u000A<p>4.  Under orders of president Obama, acting as Commander in Chief, Pakistan is now the object of routine US aerial bombardments in violation of its territorial sovereignty, using the "Global War on Terrorism" as a justification.</p>\u000A<p>5. The construction of new military bases is envisaged in Latin America including Colombia on the immediate border of Venezuela.</p>\u000A<p>6. Military aid to Israel has increased. The Obama presidency has expressed its unbending support for Israel and the Israeli military. Obama has remained mum on the atrocities committed by Israel in Gaza. There has not even been a semblance of renewed Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.</p>\u000A<p>7. There has been a reinforcement of the new regional commands including AFRICOM and SOUTHCOM</p>\u000A<p>8. A new round of threats has been directed against Iran.</p>\u000A<p>9. The US is intent upon fostering further divisions between Pakistan and India, which could lead to a regional war, as well as using India's nuclear arsenal as an indirect means to threaten China.</p>\u000A<p>The diabolical nature of this military project was outlined in the 2000 Project for a New American Century (PNAC). The PNAC's declared objectives are:</p>\u000A<p>defend the American homeland;</p>\u000A<p>fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars;</p>\u000A<p>perform the "constabulary" duties associated with shaping the security environment in critical regions;</p>\u000A<p>transform U.S. forces to exploit the "revolution in military affairs;" (Project for a New American Century, Rebuilding Americas Defenses.pdf, September 2000)</p>\u000A<p>The "Revolution in Military Affairs" refers to the development of new advanced weapons systems. The militarization of space, new advanced chemical and biological weapons, sophisticated laser guided missiles, bunker buster bombs, not to mention the US Air Force's climatic warfare program (HAARP) based in Gokona, Alaska, are part of Obama's  "humanitarian arsenal".</p>\u000A<p><span class="outline"><img id="fullSizedImage" class="media" src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk271/blastform/antennae_haarp.jpg" alt="antennae_haarp.jpg image by blastform" width="707" height="530" /></span></p>\u000A<p><span><strong>War against the Truth</strong></span></p>\u000A<p>This is a war against the truth.  When war becomes peace, the world is turned upside down. Conceptualization is no longer possible.  An inquisitorial social system emerges.</p>\u000A<p>An understanding of fundamental social and political events is replaced by a World of sheer fantasy, where "evil folks" are lurking. The objective of the "Global War on Terrorism" which has been fully endorsed by Obama administration, has been to galvanize public support for a Worldwide campaign against heresy.</p>\u000A<p>In the eyes of public opinion, possessing a "just cause" for waging war is central. A war is said to be Just if it is waged on moral, religious or ethical grounds. The consensus is to wage war. People can longer think for themselves. They accept the authority and  wisdom of the established social order.</p>\u000A<p>The Nobel Committee says that President Obama has given the world "hope for a better future." The prize is awarded for Obama's</p>\u000A<p>"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. The Committee has attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons."</p>\u000A<p>...His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population. (Nobel Press Release, October 9, 2009)</p>\u000A<p>The granting of the Nobel "peace prize" to president Barack Obama has become an integral part of the Pentagon's propaganda machine. It provides a human face to the invaders, it upholds the demonization of those who oppose US military intervention.</p>\u000A<p>The decision to grant Obama the Nobel  Peace Prize was no doubt carefully negotiated with the Norwegian Committee at the highest levels of the US government. It has far reaching implications.</p>\u000A<p>It unequivocally upholds the US led war as a "Just Cause". It erases the war crimes committed both by the Bush and Obama administrations.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://blog.syracuse.com/following-orion/2008/11/DSCF2005.JPG" alt="http://blog.syracuse.com/following-orion/2008/11/DSCF2005.JPG" width="734" height="551" /></p>\u000A<p><strong><span>War Propaganda:  Jus ad Bellum</span></strong></p>\u000A<p>The "Just war" theory serves to camouflage the nature of US foreign policy, while providing a human face to the invaders.</p>\u000A<p>In both its classical and contemporary versions, the Just war theory upholds war as a "humanitarian operation". It calls for military intervention on ethical and moral grounds against "insurgents", "terrorists", "failed" or "rogue states".</p>\u000A<p>The Just War has been heralded by the Nobel Committee as an instrument of Peace. Obama personifies the "Just War".</p>\u000A<p>Taught in US military academies, a modern-day version of the "Just War" theory has been embodied into US military doctrine. The "war on terrorism" and the notion of "preemption" are predicated on the right to "self defense." They define "when it is permissible to wage war": jus ad bellum.</p>\u000A<p>Jus ad bellum has served to build a consensus within the Armed Forces command structures. It has also served to convince the troops that they are fighting for a "just cause". More generally, the Just War theory in its modern day version is an integral part of war propaganda and media disinformation, applied to gain public support for a war agenda. Under Obama as Nobel Peace Laureate, the Just War becomes universally accepted, upheld by the so-called international community.</p>\u000A<p><em>[NB:  the term \u201Cinternational community\u201D is shorthand for the US, Israel, and Europe - a handful of arrogant and rich countries that oppress the rest of the world ]</em></p>\u000A<p>The ultimate objective is to subdue the citizens, totally depoliticize social life in America, prevent people from thinking and conceptualizing, from analyzing facts and challenging the legitimacy of the US NATO led war.</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.metc.net/img/cable%20page.jpg" alt="http://www.metc.net/img/cable%20page.jpg" width="724" height="480" /></p>\u000A<p>War becomes peace, a worthwhile "humanitarian undertaking",  Peaceful dissent becomes heresy.</p>\u000A<p>Military Escalation with a Human Face. Nobel Committee grants the "Green Light"</p>\u000A<p>More significantly, the Nobel peace prize grants legitimacy to an unprecedented  "escalation"  of US-NATO led military operations under the banner of peacemaking.</p>\u000A<p>It contributes to falsifying the nature of the US-NATO military agenda.</p>\u000A<p>Between 40,000 to 60,000 more US and allied troops are to be sent to Afghanistan under a peacemaking banner. On the 8th of October, a day prior to the Nobel Committee's decision, the US Congress granted Obama a 680-billion-dollar defense authorization bill, which is slated to finance the process of military escalation:</p>\u000A<p>"Washington and its NATO allies are planning an unprecedented increase of troops for the war in Afghanistan, even in addition to the 17,000 new American and several thousand NATO forces that have been committed to the war so far this year".</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl1/10/104169/33_2008/82293844.preview.jpg" alt="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl1/10/104169/33_2008/82293844.preview.jpg" width="715" height="475" /></p>\u000A<p>The number, based on as yet unsubstantiated reports of what U.S. and NATO commander Stanley McChrystal and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen have demanded of the White House, range from 10,000 to 45,000.</p>\u000A<p>Fox News has cited figures as high as 45,000 more American soldiers and ABC News as many as 40,000. On September 15 the Christian Science Monitor wrote of "perhaps as many as 45,000."</p>\u000A<p>The similarity of the estimates indicate that a number has been agreed upon and America's obedient media is preparing domestic audiences for the possibility of the largest escalation of foreign armed forces in Afghanistan's history. Only seven years ago the United States had 5,000 troops in the country, but was scheduled to have 68,000 by December even before the reports of new deployments surfaced. (Rick Rozoff, U.S., NATO Poised For Most Massive War In Afghanistan's History, Global Research, September 24, 2009)</p>\u000A<p>Within hours of the decision of the Norwegian Nobel committee, Obama met with the War Council, or should we call it the "Peace Council". This meeting had been carefully scheduled to coincide with that of the Norwegian Nobel committee.</p>\u000A<p>This key meeting behind closed doors in the Situation Room of the White House included Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and key political and military advisers. General  Stanley McChrystal participated in the meeting via video link from Kabul.</p>\u000A<p>General Stanley McChrystal is said to have offered the Commander in Chief "several alternative options" "including a maximum injection of 60,000 extra troops". The 60,000 figure was quoted following a leak of the Wall Street Journal (AFP: After Nobel nod, Obama convenes Afghan war council, October 9, 2009)</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://news.soc.mil/releases/News%20Archive/2004/04MAR/040313-F-2828D-201.jpg" alt="http://news.soc.mil/releases/News%20Archive/2004/04MAR/040313-F-2828D-201.jpg" width="949" height="618" /></p>\u000A<p><em>[ A photo of some hired killers getting off a C-5 Galaxy - one of the world's largest aircraft ]</em></p>\u000A<p>"The president had a robust conversation about the security and political challenges in Afghanistan and the options for building a strategic approach going forward," according to an administration official (quoted in AFP: After Nobel nod, Obama convenes Afghan war council  October 9, 2009)</p>\u000A<p>The Nobel committee had in a sense given Obama a green light.  The October 9 meeting in the Situation Room was to set the groundwork for a further escalation of the conflict under the banner of counterinsurgency and democracy building.</p>\u000A<p>Meanwhile, in the course of the last few months, US forces have stepped up their aerial bombardments of village communities in the northern tribal areas of Pakistan, under the banner of combating Al Qaeda.</p>

V<p>Dear American Express,</p>\u000A<p>How are you? I know how hard this global recession has been on everyone, so I thought I\u2019d check in on an old friend. We <em>have</em> had a professional relationship for over ten years.</p>\u000A<p>Me? Well, I\u2019m getting by. Several months ago, I was laid off with millions of other people. I had to take a job at half my prior salary and sell my house. But what am I saying? You know all this! That\u2019s right. After you saw that my credit report showed a sudden three month hiccup in my otherwise flawless finances, you called to see how I was doing. No wait. Not to see how I was doing. To unilaterally cut my credit limit from $25,000 to $1,000. Oh, and you didn\u2019t actually call. But that post card was nice.</p>\u000A<p align="center"><img src="http://cdn-i.dmdentertainment.com/funpages/cms_content/18076/amex.jpg" alt="" /></p>\u000A<p>Needless to say, this rift in our friendship left me spinning with questions. Mostly, I just want to know why. I was so good to you. I mean, yes I stopped paying my mortgage, (for the house already on the market) but I paid every single other bill. I paid all YOUR bills. Remember the good times? You were my friend \u2026 with benefits. What happened to the American Express I knew? The one who thanked me for my prompt payments and kept raising my credit limit? I got a new job. Is it my ass? It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s these new jeans. Ask Capital One, they\u2019re totally into what I got going on. It just seemed like someone over there had made a grievous error.</p>\u000A<p>So I decided to call because that\u2019s what friends do, right? They don\u2019t jump to conclusions and take rash actions without the facts. But, apparently, it wasn\u2019t an error. One of your employees \u2013let\u2019s call her BitchFace\u2014 conveyed the sentiment in a subtle way:</p>\u000A<p><img src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w148/wgladstone/mr_snibbles.jpg" alt="" />\u201CIt\u2019s not an error, Mr. Gladstone,\u201D she said, twisting her heel into the larynx of a baby chihuahua. As I bent over to see if I could find what was left of my self worth and dignity rolling away on the floor, she upped the ante:</p>\u000A<p>\u201CWe have you right where we want you.\u201D</p>\u000A<p>Yeah, I\u2019m not joking. Who says that? I think she meant Amex had me at their desired credit limit, but seriously? \u201CWe have you right where we want you\u201D is third on the list of evil phrases right behind \u201Cwe have ways of making you talk,\u201D and \u201Cwe\u2019re going to revoke your Facebook account if you keep harassing teens.\u201D</p>\u000A<p>I\u2019m not going to lie to you American Express. This was a serious test of our friendship. But once my credit report was updated it showed no mortgage debt. Indeed, I had a credit rating of over 700. I faxed you the new information, proudly. Glad that we\u2019d be able to put all this nonsense behind us, and you\u2019d be able to return my credit limit to a point higher than let\u2019s say \u2026 the cost of a high def TV or 8 nice dinners? I mean, c\u2019mon, with a $1,000 credit limit, how was I going to afford a quality hit man to kill each and every one of the miserable bastards I\u2019d spoken to at your company? I\u2019d have to use some untested soldier of fortune off craigslist and he might not be any good. He might not slice your carotid artery clean enough and you\u2019d have to die slowly over a long period of time while he did unspeakably perverted things to your increasingly lifeless corpse. None of us wanted that. So I submitted hard evidence and waited for you to do the right thing.</p>\u000A<p>Well guess what? For a cynical guy who does a <a href="http://www.cracked.com/video_17618_black-eyed-peas-have-officially-written-worst-song-ever.html">web series about hating things that suck</a>, I am surprisingly optimistic and naive. Two weeks after my financial care package you sent another post card (I guess BitchFace couldn\u2019t come to the phone) informing me that you were keeping my credit limit at $1,000.</p>\u000A<p>One thing did make me feel a little better, though. No, not the new friend I found online who is willing to torture/murder creditors for half his normal rates (although that <em>does</em> help) but finding out that I\u2019m not alone.  <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personalfinance/articles/2009/01/31/lenders_abruptly_cut_lines_of_credit/">American Express and other credit card companies have been up to all sorts of mindless shenanigans</a>, making draconian decisions based more on the appearances of cutting costs than actually understanding which clients present unreasonable risks.</p>\u000A<p>But hey, these are tough times. I get it. And I think it\u2019s completely fair that you safeguard yourself against greed and carelessness. Even if it was your greed and carelessness that put you in this situation in the first place. If making my life more difficult helps you sleep at night, then, hey, I guess that\u2019s what friends are for.</p>\u000A<p>Besides, I\u2019m very much into the idea of you sleeping soundly. My new friend tells me he works best at night.</p>\u000A<p>Wishing you every success.</p>\u000A<p>Your pal,</p>\u000A<p>Gladstone</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/?p=12808">Source</a></p>

V<p><img alt="paulgraham_ycombinator_oct09.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/images/paulgraham_ycombinator_oct09.jpg" width="150" height="161" />If hardcore hackers had any doubts whether the real-time web was a legitimate development environment, <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> co-founder Paul Graham is dispelling them. In an interview with Graham, ReadWriteWeb learned that the entrepreneur-turned-investor issued a "Request for Startups" (RFS) asking for ideas from companies utilizing <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs3.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs4.html">Justin.tv's live video API</a>. Groups who are accepted to Y-Combinator and fall under these categories will be given "priority access" to Twitter and Justin.tv. </p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16900&cb=16900" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16900&n=16900" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>Says Graham, "In the beginning people believed Twitter was a fad and they didn't realize this was a new protocol...In some ways Twitter is a replacement for email. We're not doing this to promote Twitter, we generally believe it's important."</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="ycombinator_RFS_oct09a.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/images/ycombinator_RFS_oct09a.jpg" width="510" height="390" /></p>\u000A\u000A<p>It's obvious why Y Combinator companies are able to gain special support from Justin.tv's founders. The lifecasting site took on Y Combinator seed funding in 2007 and has since developed into one of the web's leading online video destinations. The Twitter partnership is a different story. While it's important that Y Combinator teams have Twitter's support, the question on many people's minds is, "If Twitter is an all-important protocol, then why should one group of investors get privileged access to its data-rich firehose?"</p>\u000A\u000A<p>According to Graham, "This is a practical matter. They need to be able to keep ahead of growth technically... If thousands of startups want to talk to you, then you need to have filters. Even before publishing this Request for Startups, we had a dedicated guy at Twitter who answered Y Combinator questions." </p>\u000A\u000A<p>In the past, Y Combinator-funded real-time meta-search engine <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/scoopler_real-time_meta-search_for_twitter_digg_de.php">Scoopler</a> worked closely with Twitter.  </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Said Graham, "Honestly, Twitter probably has a lot of filters on those who access them. The only thing special about this is that we formalized it with an RFS." </p>\u000A\u000A<p>After taking a $2 million dollar investment from Sequoia Capital in March, Y Combinator <a href="http://ycombinator.com/party.html">aims to increase its portfolio companies from 40 to roughly 60 per year</a>. The "Request for Startups" offers companies direction in their applications. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Graham notes that when individuals apply for Y Combinator, they are asked to specify if they are applying with an RFS in mind. While he estimates that only 10% of applications are directly related to the RFS, he believes that many who might not apply are inspired to do so after seeing their ideas highlighted. The incubator's first requests were issued in August with a call for alternative <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html"> journalism</a> and <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html">online retail</a> ideas.</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/2009/10/says-paul-graham-twitter-is-th.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fkMXg0TUObiA7kIJjMespR1hPww/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fkMXg0TUObiA7kIJjMespR1hPww/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fkMXg0TUObiA7kIJjMespR1hPww/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fkMXg0TUObiA7kIJjMespR1hPww/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Dk0bRO6rfus:nvRqpy5-wo4:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/Dk0bRO6rfus" height="1" width="1" />

Moreover, writes Mullenweg, "There's also a new jQuery API that makes it easy to integrate with any text area."</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16899&cb=16899" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16899&n=16899" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>AtD founder, former military researcher, and Y-Combinator reject Rafael Mudge noted at the acquisition that he intended to continue his natural language processing research and expand support to other languages. He <a href="http://blog.afterthedeadline.com/2009/09/08/after-the-deadline-acquired/">wrote</a>, "We hope to see others build on the service... We're planning to open source the After the Deadline engine and the rule-sets that go with it.

IBM sees business analytics as the next mega trend, growing twice as fast as the rest of the IT industry.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>For example, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/conf/cognos.html"> Cognos,</a> acquired by IBM in 2007, is now a hub for IBM's business intelligence offerings.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Cognos announced its Content Analytics product at the conference. With the addition, Cognos is putting an emphasis on combining a client's internal data with external information to provide a more complete picture of the market and how to optimize marketing and processes within the organization.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="contentanalytics2.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/assets_c/2009/10/contentanalytics2-thumb-600x392-9998.jpg" width="600" height="392" class="mt-image-none" /></p>\u000A\u000A<p>This may be used to correlate transaction information with unstructured information that the client collects from the web.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Applications may include using analytics for sales purposes to get a better understanding and deeper insights into trends that come as trickles from actual purchases. The information can be analyzed with other data from sales reps about the products they are selling. This information can then be used by sales executives to predict trends and ready the rest of the organization for changes in the marketplace.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>But though this conference is about information on demand, there is little talk about the real-time web. We asked IBM executives if they can integrate activity stream information, such as a Twitter search pertaining to a company name or product. They said it was possible though it is unclear exactly how this would be accomplished. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Most of the examples we saw with Cognos Content Analytics focused on massive amounts of form data that can be viewed in a dashboard. That's impressive but we would like to see how IBM is leveraging the social web and how they plan to compete against the number of lightweight social technologies that are filling the market.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><em>[Disclosure: IBM paid for a plane ticket and hotel room for Alex Williams to attend the IBM Information On Demand Conference.]</em><br />\u000A</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2009/10/we-are-here-at-the.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ouZ7L5bIOPz9_jGBurL4WpnRoOc/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ouZ7L5bIOPz9_jGBurL4WpnRoOc/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ouZ7L5bIOPz9_jGBurL4WpnRoOc/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ouZ7L5bIOPz9_jGBurL4WpnRoOc/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=lq2pOV3cgtQ:rGjbXjy9fn4:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/lq2pOV3cgtQ" height="1" width="1" />

But if you are a diehard sports addict, you've probably been one since you were a kid. We watched in awe when Nolan Ryan pitched a 101 mph fast ball at the age of forty, when Air Jordan effortlessly dunked from the free throw line and when Joe Montana set the record for most yards passing during Super Bowl XIX. When you've been present to watch sports history, you can't turn your back on the game now. Nevertheless, with so much happening at once, below are a few tools that can help you juggle multiple games:</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16897&cb=16897" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16897&n=16897" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>1. <img alt="sports_fanfeedr_oct09.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/images/sports_fanfeedr_oct09.jpg" width="317" height="477" align="right" /><b><a href="http://lockerblogger.com">Lockerblogger</a></b>: Lockerblogger offers users a chance to create fan profiles and track the sports they're most interested in.

V<p><img alt="google_logo_jan_09.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/google_logo_jan_09.jpg" />Social Search just went <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/introducing-google-social-search-i.html">live </a>in <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/">Google Labs</a>. Google <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_social_search_facebook.php">announced</a> that it was working on this Social Search feature at the Web 2.0 Summit last week, but at that time, Google's Marissa Mayer announced that it would only be available "in a few weeks." <font></font>Social Search taps into a user's social network profiles and displays relevant links and status updates that members of a user's own social network have shared at the bottom of the default search results page. According to Google, Social Search will enhance the search experience on Google by providing users with more personally relevant search results.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16894&cb=16894" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16894&n=16894" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>To get started, you first have to head over to <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/">Google Labs</a>'s experimental section and activate this feature. For now, Social Search will only be available in the US and in English. </p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="google_social_search_nz_example.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/google_social_search_nz_example.jpg" /></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Sources: Gmail Contacts, Google Reader Subscriptions and Your Google Profile</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Social Search can tab into three different sources, so you will need accounts on at least one of these services to make Social Search work. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Social search uses the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/To get started, you first have to head over to Google Labs&rsquo;s experimental section and activate this feature. ">Gmail contacts</a> you have added to your friends and coworker lists and those you have chatted with on Google Talk. Social search also looks at your&#160;<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> subscriptions and the social networking profiles you have added to your Google Profile. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>While you don't need to have a <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles">Google Profile</a>, this service is a hub for your social networking profile on Social Search. Based on the information in your Google Profile, Google can <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">auto-detect your social networking profiles</a> and your friends on services like Flickr, FriendFeed, YouTube, Reddit, Digg, del.icio.us, BrightKite and many others. </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>How it Works and How to Trigger Social Search Explicitly</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Once activated, Social Search results will appear at the bottom of the standard search results page and will be clearly labeled as "results from people in your social circle." As Google's search evangelist Matt Cutts pointed out to us in an interview earlier today, it is important to note that not every search will trigger Social Search results. When it does, however, the results should be highly relevant. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>You can also explicitly trigger Social Search from the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/behind-scenes-of-search-options-panel.html">search options panel</a>. There, Google will now also present a list of your friends that it thinks are the most closely related to the keywords you were searching for. By clicking on a name, you can restrict your search even further and just see results from this one person.</p>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<p>&#160;</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Social Search Makes Google Profiles More Useful</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>This new feature will also put a new emphasis on Google Profiles. Google has made some moves to make these profiles more prominent by highlighting some profiles when users search for people, but Google Profiles has generally not received a lot of attention from users. Now, however, as the hub for Social Search, users have an incentive to fill out their profiles - which, of course, will also give Google more information about you and your social network.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Privacy Concerns?</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>We talked to Google Fellow <a href="http://singhal.info/">Amit Singhal</a>, search evangelist <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/">Matt Cutts</a>, and Maureen Heymans (the Technical Lead for Social Search) and Murali Viswanathan (the Product Manager for Social Search) earlier today and the team was obviously excited about this launch. The Social Search team was especially excited about the fact social search will now make your friends' knowledge far more accessible than ever before and that this will make it easier to find trusted product reviews and local search results.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="social_search_2_oct09.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/social_search_2_oct09.jpg" /></p>\u000A\u000A<p>We also asked the team about how they thought users would react to the fact that Google indexes and surfaces all of their social networking profiles and connections, which could spark some privacy concerns. In reaction to this, Matt Cutts pointed out that all of the info that Google indexes is already publically available on the Internet, including a user's friend connections.

Both Google and Facebook want users to come to their sites to see what their friends are saying about a given topic. Google, however, can't tap into your social circle on Facebook and hence won't be able to highlight status updates from your Facebook friends, which explains why Google needed to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_indexes_twitter.php">make a deal with Twitter</a> to get access to status updates from their service.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="social_search_real_time_example.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/social_search_real_time_example.jpg" /></p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_search_gets_personal_social_search_launches.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/jqAimhJMyavX7gV_TBc932lh-p8/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/jqAimhJMyavX7gV_TBc932lh-p8/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/jqAimhJMyavX7gV_TBc932lh-p8/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/jqAimhJMyavX7gV_TBc932lh-p8/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=KDK95zWhQys:qKNq0c-OlH4:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/KDK95zWhQys" height="1" width="1" />

Those are the stories behind the hottest videos from the eye and brain-candy world of Augmented Reality, as seen at last week's <a href="http://www.ismar09.org/">International Symposium on Augmented and Extended Reality</a> in Orlando, Florida.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Who says the web is all about <em>pages</em> that you view in a <em>browser</em>?  Check out these three visions of a fast-approaching future where data is drawn from and overlaid on top of the real world around us.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16895&cb=16895" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16895&n=16895" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Kid Stuff: Eye Pet</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>The <a href="http://www.eyepet.com/">Eye Pet</a> is a virtual critter that you can interact with through a webcam on your computer.  Check out this demo where the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe pets the animal and spins through a 3D menu of toys to play use in playing with it.  It's pretty awesome.  The Eye Pet is expected to be released <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRBAlSxinL4&NR=1">for the PS3 game system</a> as early as next month.</p>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<p>That looks like a lot of fun for kids (who knows about the psychological impact) but imagine other interactive 3D objects with menus of options like this.  Occupational training possibilities?  Sports practice?  There seems to be a lot of possibilities.  </p>\u000A\u000A<p><em>Thanks to Canadian PhD student <a href="http://compscigail.blogspot.com/">Gail Carmichael</a> for shooting that video.</em></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>The New AR Paradigm: AR Sketch</h2>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<p>We <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_augmented_reality_hack.php">wrote about this international project last week</a> and the team behind it went on to win the Best Student Paper award at the ISMAR conference.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>AR Sketch takes drawn images, processes live video capture of the drawings and turns them into 3D image overlays.  Then it subjects them to a physics simulation.  The team behind it just happened to hack into the private API for live video processing on the iPhone and make it available to developers around the world, too. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Popular AR apps like Yelp or Layar on mobile phones don't actually know what they are looking at, they just know where you are and which direction you're facing.  Thus they can tell you what they believe you're looking at.  Marker-based AR apps know only to look for one thing - a printed marker with a pattern on it that triggers display of an overlay.  Sketch AR needs neither guesses nor markers - it processes  and augments what you're actually looking at.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>It's nuts.  As Ori Inbar wrote about the Sketch AR team in <a href="http://gamesalfresco.com/2009/10/23/ismar-2009-epilogue-a-new-augmented-reality-world-order/">an overview of ISMAR</a>, "Their work is revolutionizing the AR world by avoiding the need to print markers - or any images whatsoever."</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Here Comes Microsoft AR!</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Oxford's <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/">Georg Klein</a>, whom Inbar calls "the smartest Computer Vision guy on the block," just joined Microsoft this month, conference-goers learned.  Is Microsoft going to make a major Augmented Reality play?  They'd be fools not to explore the possibility.  They don't want to be left out in the cold if AR does become the next version of the web.  Here's what their new man's been working on.</p>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<p><a href="http://www.vuzix.com/iwear/products_wrap310.html"><img alt="wrap310.jpg" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/wrap310.jpg" width="325" height="189" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" /></a>These exciting examples of Augmented Reality have little to do with mobile location awareness, a nice reminder that there's a whole lot more to the field.  Mobile AR browsers are the best known commercial services so far, but academic research on other forms of AR has been going on for years.  </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Ready to browse and interact with data on top of the physical world, through webcams, mobile phones and increasingly <a href="http://www.vuzix.com/iwear/products_wrap310.html">svelte AR glasses</a>?

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/getglue.jpg" />Once just a browser add-on that allowed users to surf smarter across several verticals, AdaptiveBlue's <a href="http://getglue.com">Glue</a> is now a site-centric product that acts as both a hub and a spoke of the social web.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Glue's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/echo_creator_khris_loux_on_the_ties_that_bind_the.php">synaptic web</a>-esque technology is based on a user's browsing across common sites such as Amazon, Wikipedia and YouTube, and those visits and any interactions (comments, "likes," etc.) feeding back to automatically create a taste profile and a web of affinity with other users and recommendations of other items or content across about a dozen categories, including music, books and movies. So, can this be done without violating users' privacy or - worse yet - frustrating and boring them into attrition?</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16893&cb=16893" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16893&n=16893" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p><em>[Disclosure: AdaptiveBlue founder and CEO Alex Iskold is a ReadWriteWeb writer.]</em></p>\u000A\u000A<p>AdaptiveBlue VP Fraser Kelton thinks both aims can be accomplished. In a phone interview this morning, he shared that Glue has a three-tiered set of privacy controls to ensure that items are shared only when a user wants them to be. As the privacy/permissions inverse of Facebook Beacon, an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_beacon_apology.php">ill-fated</a> system for socially powered product recommendation, the Glue system is completely opt-in for users and opt-out for publishers.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/glue1.jpg" /><em>Glue's all-new user profiles are rolling out today at GetGlue.com.</em></p>\u000A\u000A<p><br />\u000A"Nobody's confortable sharing all of their stream," said Kelton. "Financial sites, adult content - we don't want any of that stuff shared." In addition to having a set list of sites from which to pull browsing and interaction data, Kelton said, "The secondary privacy controls can prevent visits to a website from being shared unless the user has a specific interaction on that site. You can also opt to have a private profile so only your friends can see the items you interact with." Finally, Kelton told us that users can delete or edit their own shared content on an item-by-item basis.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Our other concern was whether Glue would be a semantic web geek-fest or whether the average end user would also be able to use, enjoy, and return to the site. Kelton said the site went over well with non-techie beta testers, many of whom started out using the GetGlue.com website and eventually also installed the add-on for an even richer experience.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>One of the factors we think makes Glue so much fun for end users, from geeks to complete Luddites, is its Foursquare-like system of achievement and rewards. "We're big fans of game interaction driving the user experience," said Kelton, who also revealed that the product team considered Xbox 360 as inspiration for the Glue system. Users can earn stickers on their profiles based on how many items they browse or interact with, how many users discover content through them, and how much of an expert they are on a particular topic.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/glue2.jpg" /><em>Glue's game-like system of badges or stickers as rewards for user interactions and discovery makes for addictive browsing.</em></p>\u000A\u000A<p>Each item indexed by Glue can have a guru, and only one guru at a time. The result is friendly competition, increased interactions and a very sticky website that's compelling and entertaining for even the least technical end user.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The site also allows for content to be pushed to a user's existing social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Here's a demo video showing more about how the site works:</p>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<p>As previously mentioned, the user experience of Glue - both the site and the revamped add-on - is one of synapses and nodes, not back-and-forth browsing and search for content. As data and content from all around the web is associated with films, books, music, and other items, users are able to quickly scan and consume related content without further navigation. This type of curated experience is something the AdaptiveBlue team calls "shortcut search."</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/glue3.jpg" /><em>As a social network, GetGlue.com is a hub; but the way it curates content makes it a series of spokes, as well.</em></p>\u000A\u000A<p>"You don't have to go to Rotten Tomatoes or YouTube. We know there's a subset of information users want, and we're bringing it in," said Kelton, who is very excited about Glue's position on distributed social networking and the semantic web. "Jeremiah [Owyang] uses the term 'social colonization.' I also think we're implementing what Charlene Li talks about when she uses the phrase, 'The network is all around us.'"</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/getgluecom_distributed_networking_recommendation.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/8tYp-cw7sKsu0DkEp2MFYJz-F6w/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/8tYp-cw7sKsu0DkEp2MFYJz-F6w/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/8tYp-cw7sKsu0DkEp2MFYJz-F6w/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/8tYp-cw7sKsu0DkEp2MFYJz-F6w/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=FndgulQT6p8:we4hwdbELI4:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/FndgulQT6p8" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/fb-share.jpg" />Joining the ranks of tools such as Tweetmeme and Digg widgets, Facebook's Share button will now be showing the number of users who share items in real time - and with a new set of analytics features.</p>\u000A\u000A<div><a name="fb_share" type="box_count"></a></div>\u000A\u000A<p>Facebook Platform product manager Mark Kinsey <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=323">writes</a> on the Facebook Developers blog, "Today we're making the sharing experience on Facebook and off even richer by launching the next version of Facebook Share, with a live counter, as well as new ways to measure how content is being shared on Facebook."</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16892&cb=16892" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16892&n=16892" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>While the cosmetic change is a nice feature for end users, the real news here is the analytics on the back end.

V<p><img alt="emarketer_logo_jul09.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/emarketer_logo_jul09.png" />Social networking sites are quickly becoming one of the most important places where retailers can meet potential customers and interact with their current customer base. According to a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1007347">new report from eMarketer</a>, social network users are a lucrative target demographic because they are more likely to make online purchases than any other group. About three-quarters of all the retailers in the Internet Retailer <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/top500guide/">Top 500 Guide</a> maintain a presence on at least one social network. Facebook, YouTube and MySpace are the most popular social networking sites for online retailers.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16890&cb=16890" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16890&n=16890" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Online Retailers Experiment with Twitter, But They Really Love Facebook's Platform</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>According to eMarkter's report, 56.8% of online retailers maintain a Facebook presence, 41.4% are on YouTube and 28.6% use MySpace. Twitter comes in at #4, as only 20.4% of all online merchants actively maintain a Twitter account. As eMarkteter points out, Twitter is a 'hotbed for experimentation,' where companies can promote deals and interact directly with their customers. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>For the majority of companies, however, Facebook is the most lucrative place to meet current and potential customers. Facebook's platforms give retailers ranging from 1-800-Flowers to Papa John's Pizza the ability to create <a href="http://www.marketingvox.com/1-800-flowers-pings-facebook-for-ecommerce-044752/">e-commerce applications</a> and provide users with services right on Facebook. </p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="emarketer_shopping_stats_oct09.png" align="right" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/emarketer_shopping_stats_oct09.png" />According to an earlier <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1007296">eMarkter report</a>, almost 99% of all US Online Retailers plan to have a Facebook fan site within the next year (up from 86% today), and 85% plan to use Twitter within the next 12 months.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Consumers Want Online Retailers to be on Social Networks</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>This trend, of course, isn't new, but it's also clear that online retailers will have to continue to follow their customers to where they are - and today, that means social networks like Twitter and Facebook. We also know that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/majority_of_social_media_users_want_businesses_attention.php">consumers want to interact with brands</a> and online retailers through social networks, so any company that isn't using these tools is bound to miss out on potential sales. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>These customers are also highly likely to spread the word about a product - good or bad - on these social networks, so smart retailers will not just have a presence on these networks, but also use them to reach out directly to their customers. </p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet_retailers_love_facebook_youtube_and_myspa.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ERvOqvHIa8-68pyY1zqys0LtQII/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ERvOqvHIa8-68pyY1zqys0LtQII/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ERvOqvHIa8-68pyY1zqys0LtQII/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/ERvOqvHIa8-68pyY1zqys0LtQII/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=Xk8q-Wkr5V8:NecRBXMaBdw:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/Xk8q-Wkr5V8" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/hulu_logo_sep08.png" />Everyone is looking to <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a> as the future of Internet TV. The joint venture between several major networks, Hulu delivers free, ad-supported programming via online streams - an untested model for long-term profitability, at least when it comes to television. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>While consumers have been enjoying the service since its launch in 2007, happily watching free TV shows and movies over their PCs and even their TV sets thanks to Media Center plugins and other <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/watching_hulu_and_much_more_on_your_apple_tv/">unofficial hacks</a>, the company itself is still trying to navigate this new online landscape and effectively monetize their content. Now recent statements by a News Corp exec have people wondering: can Hulu make the ad-supported model work? Or does the company have other plans? </p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16889&cb=16889" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16889&n=16889" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Is Hulu Working?</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>One of the primary objectives behind Hulu was to put free programming on the Internet to combat the rampant pirating of TV content that took place on sites like the popular file-sharing destination, The Pirate Bay. As iTunes did with music, the idea is to make using Hulu's service easier than having to go out and seek the illegal downloads. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Although iTunes charges for music on a per-file basis, Hulu, too has a business model that makes you pay - except in their case, you're paying with your eyeballs, not your credit card. Using video ads, Hulu has been attempting to monetize its service, but those efforts have been difficult at times. This spring, for instance, Screen Digest analyst Arash Amel claimed that Hulu had only sold about 60% of its ad inventory. "What we've seen is rapid growth in consumption, but the advertising isn't keeping up," <a href="http://newteevee.com/2009/03/31/analyst-hulu-to-bring-in-120-million-in-09/">he said</a>.</p> \u000A\u000A<p>While these figures, if accurate, could be reason for concern, many feel that the profitability of an online video venture of this nature takes time to develop. Eventually, the ad-supported model would work for Hulu as it has worked for numerous other websites and services, supporters claim. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Besides, more recent deals seem to bode well for the site. Case in point, this month the Publicis Groupe announced<a href="http://www.marketing-interactive.com/news/15525"> a mulit-million dollar ad deal </a>that involved targeted advertising to particular Hulu demographics. The deal is said to represent a "significant increase" in spending on Hulu. </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Hulu to Charge?</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Despite the promises ad deals like this hold, there is still debate as to whether or not Hulu is going to stick to the ad-supported model or try something new. At a conference last week, News Corp. deputy chairman Chase Carey made a pronouncement regarding this point that raised more than a few eyebrows:</p>\u000A\u000A<p>"I think a free model is a very difficult way to capture the value of our content. I think what we need to do is deliver that content to consumers in a way where they will appreciate the value,&quot; Carey <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/ADverse_Atkinson_on_Advertising/23941-Chase_Carey_Hulu_to_Charge_in_2010.php?nid=2228&source=title&rid=6454445">was quoted as saying by Broadcasting &amp; Cable</a>. "Hulu...needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business."</p>\u000A\u000A<p>This seems to jibe with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/hulu_to_add_subscription_services_pay-per-view.php">earlier reports</a> where News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch also hinted at the site's plans to add premium services by saying, "Are we looking at it with a view toward adding subscription services and pay per view? Yes we are." </p>\u000A\u000A<p>But "looking at" and "doing" are two very different things - where does Hulu stand now? Has their core philosophy - that is, their belief in the ad-supported model - changed? </p>\u000A\u000A<p>According to <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i62edbb41c75b175b959732a5437c873c"> AdWeek</a>, it has <u>not</u>. In the article, the company claims their ad-supported free service is still the one that "resonates with the largest group of users" and that any additional models would just serve to complement that.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>However, when we reached out to Hulu to ask about their plans regarding charging for content, the company wouldn't go on record with any such statement. </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Why So Cagey? </h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Hulu's current decision to clam up could be taken in a few different ways. Perhaps they simply haven't decided what they're going to do about adding new premium services to Hulu and therefore don't want to discuss it <em>at all. </em></p>\u000A\u000A<p>Yet the quote they provided to AdWeek seems innocuous enough - so why not just stick with it? Why now choose to say nothing at all? Maybe they're hoping that with no quote, there is no story, and that will allow them to quell the impending panic among some users who are worried about Hulu's plans to make customers pay. Because some people are so opposed to paying for online content, just hearing reports that Hulu <em>might </em>change to a pay-to-stream model could dissuade them from continuing to use the service. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Then again, it could be that the opposite is true. Hulu wants to keep everyone wondering about what's coming next, generating excitement without providing any details. This means people can speculate wildly and give their opinions, allowing Hulu to tap into that online conversation about what people want before making any official decisions or announcements. </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>What We Think: Hulu Will Launch Value-Added Services</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>Despite any official confirmations from the company, we think it's pretty clear that Hulu has intentions to launch value-added services on top of its free, ad-supported model in the coming months. These may include pay-per-view options and some sort of subscription model. However, that subscription model would be there to provide users with value-added services that you couldn't get from the free model alone. Perhaps behind the scenes interviews? Sneak peeks? Actor interviews? Who knows...but the possibilities are endless. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>As to why we think that, it comes down to simple math. We've now seen three different statements about these premium services: Carey's recent remarks, Murdoch's quote from earlier this year, and <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2009/10/sources-say-hulu-waiting-for-subscription-service-before-launching-iphone-app.html">anonymous sources quoted by Dan Rayburn</a> who hinted that Hulu's iPhone app won't launch until "Hulu rolls out a subscription based service." </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>...And They'll be Tied to the iPhone</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>The iPhone app, in fact, may be the real secret the company is trying to hide. Imagine if <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090417/p64#a090417p64">the much-rumored and highly anticipated application</a> was linked to a subscription-based model. That could downright <em>revolutionize</em> the way people watch TV. Providing streaming content over the popular Apple smartphone would easily bring in additional revenue and that new source could quickly outperform the profits made by the ad-supported model. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Yet launching a Hulu iPhone app would be a challenge, as the company is undoubtedly aware. And, of course, Hulu wouldn't want to say anything about it, especially considering how difficult Apple is when it comes to applications that compete with their core services. Apple may not even approve such an application, claiming (rightly so) that it competes with iTunes. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>However, Apple may be loosening up on that front, with no small thanks going to the FCC <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/did-apple-lie-about-rejecting-google-voice-iphone-app-2009-9">who recently questioned the company's rejection of the Google Voice application</a> - a VoIP dialer that Apple rejected because it competed with what the iPhone does natively. (Apple claims they're "still reviewing" it, but no one really buys that.) Since the FCC's involvement, however, Apple has gone on to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/spotify_iphone_app_approved_thanks_to_the_fcc.php">approve a streaming music app called Spotify</a>, an application that many had feared would be rejected because it, even more so than Google Voice, competed with iTunes. That leaves us hopeful that a similar application launched by Hulu could also make it through the approval process. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Still, we wouldn't blame Hulu if they wanted to keep that extremely quiet. And that would certainly explain why Hulu won't comment on their plans. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Of course, this is all just speculation at this point, but we hope it turns out to be true.</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_are_hulus_mysterious_plans.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/w7J8ttCpp9wdx6UxaoY5ak5Bolw/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/w7J8ttCpp9wdx6UxaoY5ak5Bolw/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/w7J8ttCpp9wdx6UxaoY5ak5Bolw/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/w7J8ttCpp9wdx6UxaoY5ak5Bolw/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=itQYd1Nftno:E5I06CULPEg:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/itQYd1Nftno" height="1" width="1" />

V<em><strong><p>Proposal Would Kill Beacon, Have Facebook Paying $9.5 Million</p>\u000A</strong></em>\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/facebook_logo_feb09.png" />Late last week, a federal judge in California gave preliminary approval to a settlement of the class action lawsuit regarding Facebook's Beacon program. The controversial program, launched back in November of 2007, allowed Facebook users to share online purchases made on third-party affiliate websites with their social networking friends. The problem with the program was that it was opt-out instead of opt-in, angering many Facebook users who unknowingly shared information they wished they wouldn't have.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16888&cb=16888" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16888&n=16888" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A<p>One such victim was Sean Lane, now the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. He was especially angry after the news of an Overstock.com purchase was posted to his Facebook profile. The purchase, a diamond ring he bought for his wife, was meant to be a surprise. After that incident, Lane, along with eighteen other plaintiffs, filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook, claiming that Beacon's opt-out option was "inadequate, misleading and deceptive." </p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Details of the Agreement: Shutting Down Beacon, Paying Damages, Non-Profit Foundation</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>The case has been in litigation since last year, but now looks like it's drawing to a close. U.S. District Court judge, Richard Seeborg in San Jose, has approved the proposed Facebook settlement that would have the company paying out $9.5 million, two-thirds of which would go to setting up a non-profit foundation to fund "projects and initiatives that promote the cause of online privacy, safety and security." The remaining money would then be split among the lawyers and the plaintiffs, each of whom would receive damages of $1000-15,000, according to <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=116053">MediaPost</a>. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>The other major part to the Facebook settlement is the required termination of Facebook's Beacon program in its entirety. Although Facebook had quickly reacted to the Beacon outcry after its launch, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_data_collection_update.php">changing the system over to opt-in</a> and even issuing <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_beacon_apology.php">a formal apology</a>, the program still exists today. (You can check your settings by going to Settings -&gt; Privacy Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Settings tab. Then scroll down to the bottom to see if "Beacon websites" is checked or unchecked. Checked will ensure no Beacon stories get posted to your profile).</p>\u000A\u000A<p>If the proposed settlement goes through, Facebook would then be relieved from liability from any future lawsuits regarding the same complaint and even those still pending like the <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=80839">Facebook/Blockbuster class action suit</a> brought in April 2008.</p>\u000A\u000A<h2>Settlement Sounds Great...Especially for Facebook</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>On the surface, the proposed settlement sounds fair enough to all parties involved. Damages are paid and Facebook has to promote online privacy. However, as David Johnson points out on the <a href="http://www.digitalmedialawyerblog.com/2009/09/lane_v_facebook_privacy_class_1.html">Digital Media Lawyer Blog</a>, Facebook is <em>already </em>required by law to promote online privacy and the safety and security of its users' information per FTC mandates. In addition, Facebook would get to nominate one and have say over the other two board members on the proposed Privacy Foundation's board of directors. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Says Johnson: "Facebook effectively gets most of its money back to fund projects that it is already has an obligation to perform." </p>\u000A\u000A<p>Sounds like the real winner here may be Facebook. </p>\u000A\u000A<p><em>You can read the Settlement Agreement </em><a href="http://spamnotes.com/files/31236-29497/BeaconSettlement.pdf"><em>here</em></a><em>, courtesy of </em><a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/a_look_at_the_facebook_privacy_class_action_beacon_settlement/"><em>CircleID</em></a><em>. The settlement was proposed last month, but only received preliminary approval on Friday. The affected parties have until February 1st to object to the proposed settlement.</em></p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_settlement_gets_judges_ok.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/RuOHbkc0ElK-LhNuq-Cw4sGDBBU/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/RuOHbkc0ElK-LhNuq-Cw4sGDBBU/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/RuOHbkc0ElK-LhNuq-Cw4sGDBBU/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/RuOHbkc0ElK-LhNuq-Cw4sGDBBU/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=kwDgnJKA0r8:cCbhXVKQKmQ:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/kwDgnJKA0r8" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><img alt="greystripe_logo_oct09.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/greystripe_logo_oct09.png" />According to a new survey by mobile advertising network <a href="http://www.greystripe.com/">Greystripe</a>, mothers with iPhones regularly let their children use their phones, download games specifically for their children and often use their phones at grocery stores to compare prices and check their grocery lists.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Not too long ago, mothers were still considered to be a hard group to reach through mobile applications because they tend to be late adopters. The iPhone's mainstream success has changed this, however, and iPhone moms have now become a desirable target demographic for marketers.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16885&cb=16885" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16885&n=16885" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<div><a name="fb_share" type="box_count" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php">Share</a></div>\u000A<p>Greystripe is a brand-focused advertising network and obviously has an interest in making this group attractive for advertisers, but the statistics in this report seem pretty solid. Greystripe found the 1,294 respondents who filled out this survey through house ads on its own network. </p>\u000A\u000A<p></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>The iPhone Mom</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>According to Greystripe, 96% of mothers with iPhones are involved in their family's purchasing decisions and 40% are the sole decision makers. Eighty percent have attended at least some college and are slightly more likely to have received a Graduate degree than the rest of the iPhone user base. The age of the children in these families skews slightly older, with 29% of the moms having children between 0 and 4, while 43% have children between 15 and 17.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="iphone_moms_stats.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/iphone_moms_stats.png" /></p>\u000A\u000A<h2>How iPhone Moms Use Their Phones: Shopping and Keeping the Kids Entertained</h2>\u000A\u000A<p>What is more interesting, though, is how these moms use their iPhones. Fifty-nine percent of all iPhone moms let their children use their phones and 41% download games specifically for their children. Twenty percent also download educational content for their kids. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>With regards to shopping, 79% of all iPhone moms use their phones for 'shopping related activities.' The majority of these activities consist of locating stores (60%). Thirty-nine percent also use the phone to compare prices. Nineteen percent of iPhone moms download coupons, 23% look for items on sale and 37% use their phones to learn about products. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>When it comes to using the phone in stores, 42% of the mothers who responded to the Greystripe survey said that they regularly use their phones at the grocery store. Grocery list applications - or just the Notes app on the iPhone and iPod touch - are the most popular uses for the iPhone and 19% of all moms use these. Thirteen percent of moms also use the phone to look up prices in the store itself - which explains the popularity of apps like <a href="http://www.redlaser.com/">Red Laser</a>.</p>\u000A\u000A<p><img alt="greystripe_moms_stats_2.png" src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/greystripe_moms_stats_2.png" /></p>\u000A\u000A<p>As Greystripe's founder and CEO Michael Chang told us last week, this data shows how the iPhone has become a tool for everyday life for this demographic. This group tends to have a large influence over everyday purchase decisions in their families and these iPhone moms often use their phones to make a good number of these decisions, which make them an attractive target for marketers.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>This study also shows that there is a large market for apps that are specifically geared towards this demographic, including mobile price comparison apps or apps that can deliver mobile coupons - and a lot of iPhone dads will probably be interested in these apps as well.</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_moms_shopping_entertaining_kids.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/VZ_u14MW9TOlQl2c2iWMQ0dSRIY/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/VZ_u14MW9TOlQl2c2iWMQ0dSRIY/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/VZ_u14MW9TOlQl2c2iWMQ0dSRIY/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/VZ_u14MW9TOlQl2c2iWMQ0dSRIY/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=ATClBOcKqjw:2VrbtYhaAPQ:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/ATClBOcKqjw" height="1" width="1" />

V<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/breadcrumbs_150.jpg" />Today at the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/conf/">IBM Information on Demand</a> event, IBM will demo a new app that will bring the Internet of Things to the iPhone. The as yet unreleased iPhone app is called <strong>Breadcrumbs</strong> and it will give consumers access to information about grocery food items. The app will be able to scan barcodes and deliver a summary of the ingredients in a food item, along with when it was manufactured. That data is usually on the food label, but Breadcrumbs goes a step further - it can provide extra information such as product recall data. If a product has been recalled in the past, this app will tell the consumer all of the relevant details.</p>\u000A<p align="right"><em>Sponsor</em><br /><a href="http://d1.openx.org/ck.php?n=16887&cb=16887" target="_blank"><img src="http://d1.openx.org/avw.php?zoneid=11205&cb=16887&n=16887" border="0" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/ibm_breadcrumbs.jpg" align="right" />Breadcrumbs is able to scan barcodes using the iPhone's camera. The consumer simply points their iPhone at a food item and gets back relevant data. Other than product recall details, the information returned to the user is mostly the same as what's on food labels - only it is pulled from the Web. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>IBM told ReadWriteWeb that when 4G becomes common place in mobile phones, then apps such as Breadcrumbs will become more powerful and be readily used on-the-fly by consumers when grocery shopping.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The larger trend here is <strong>the convergence of smart phones with the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_5_web_trends_of_2009_internet_of_things.php">Internet of Things</a></strong> (i.e. Internet-connected real world objects). Devices such as the iPhone essentially become sensor and RFID readers, which allow consumers to interact with real world objects in a much more detailed manner.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Breadcrumbs is a glimpse of what we'll see in the near future, when information will literally - <em>finally</em> - be at the consumer's fingertips when they're shopping for groceries or any other goods where data is plentiful. Up till now, data such as product recall information has largely been inaccessible to consumers - at least when at the grocery store. </p>\u000A\u000A<p>In the long term expect to see apps like Breadcrumbs provide data on where and when food items get consumed, together with how long they were on the shelf before being consumed. Apps like Breadcrumbs may even be able to tell <em>who</em> consumed the items (privacy advocates, start your engines!). These apps will also be useful in determining counterfeit items, for example when buying an expensive luxury good.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>The date that Breadcrumbs will be launched on iPhone has not yet been announced by IBM.</p>\u000A<strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ibm_debuts_food_traceability_iphone_app.php#comments-open">Discuss</a></strong>\u000A<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/bk3iW2dvcLHVj-4Kb0ErrU8ud8E/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/bk3iW2dvcLHVj-4Kb0ErrU8ud8E/0/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a><br />\u000A<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/bk3iW2dvcLHVj-4Kb0ErrU8ud8E/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/bk3iW2dvcLHVj-4Kb0ErrU8ud8E/1/di" border="0" ismap="true" /></a></p><div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:FFnlKYwJmN0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=FFnlKYwJmN0" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X9j17HWcxWI:b5o_wTrLtxg:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/X9j17HWcxWI" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>Earlier this year at the Enterprise 2.0 conference \u201Cplatform\u201D was the name of choice. Seemingly every company I spoke to was a platform player. It seems the latest \u201Cfart on demand\u201D <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="iPhone" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> application is a \u201Cplatform for virtual flatulence generation\u201D, that the latest <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> clone with negligible uptake is \u201Ca platform for global collaboration\u201D and the maker of a time tracking widget is \u201Ca platform for enterprise efficiency and ROI generation\u201D \u2013 I can\u2019t help but rail against that and yell \u201Cenough of the platform already!\u201D</p>\u000A<p>One of the sessions at the conference included half a dozen or so vendors of microblogging products, true they all had various takes on the theme and offered different services, but they shared the common feature of providing microblogging. Somewhat surprisingly every one of them proclaimed that they were a platform. I couldn\u2019t help but ask a somewhat tongue-in-cheek question \u2013 when every single product on the web calls itself a platform, we\u2019ll have to invent a new word to let wannabe players impress VCs.</p>\u000A<p>The inimitable Phil Wainewright recently released an excellent <span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ippblog.intuit.com/blog/2009/10/redefining-software-platforms---how-paas-changes-the-game-for-isvs.html">report</a></span> looking at different aspects of PaaS, I thought I'd try and bring a&nbsp;philosophical&nbsp;bent to the&nbsp;discussion.</p>\u000A<p>In my mind, to claim the moniker \u201Cplatform\u201D a service needs to have a number of attributes; an ecosystem, critical mass, beachhead status and openness. So what different types of platforms do I see out there?</p>\u000A<p><strong>Monotheistic platforms</strong></p>\u000A<p>What I\u2019ve playfully called monotheistic platforms leverage one particular business process and attempt to build a platform around that. It\u2019ll always be a niche but so long as it\u2019s a big enough niche it\u2019s worth following. <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Force.com" href="http://force.com/">Force.com</a> is the originator of the <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Platform as a service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> moniker. It\u2019s clearly gaining an ecosystem, with third parties developing applications that live within its world and it\u2019s also seemingly gaining some critical mass. Force.com however is less than open \u2013 it dictates how applications can be written, it dictates (to a certain extent) how applications look and it\u2019s central view of the world is CRM-centric (although admittedly less so now than even a few months ago). Force.com is a platform but it\u2019s what I\u2019ll call a niche platform.</p>\u000A<p><strong>Like Switzerland, only different, and bigger</strong></p>\u000A<p>Platforms that span the divide between on-premises and SaaS and that do so in a neutral way are arguably something of a nirvana. These platforms interact seamlessly with the web environment, while also federating to on-premises applications. They also broaden the offering such that vendors can chose parts of the stack to adopt (billing, authentication, data models etc). As for size, like anything in business, reach is critical and this is where the incumbent players have an edge \u2013 having the ability to leverage an existing customer based but introduce them to a platform is the gold many platform plays would die for. I\u2019ve <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=008057045071378771690:c-gaqnbeaks&ie=UTF-8&q=ipp&sa=Search">written</a> before about the <span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/">Intuit Partner Platform</a></span> (<em>disclosure \u2013 IPP is a client</em>) and I contend that it\u2019s an exemplar of this type of platform play \u2013 both from a vendor perspective and an end-user centric viewpoint.</p>\u000A<p><strong>Ego Platforms \u2013 The Id</strong></p>\u000A<p>To use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego,_and_super-ego">Freud\u2019s term</a>, these platforms cater for the Id part of our personalities \u2013 these social platforms are built around individuals core desire to connect and find meaning from the people around them \u2013 exhibit one, <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. One can\u2019t deny that Facebook has true critical mass, it also has a plethora of third parties creating offerings surrounding it. It\u2019s beachhead proposition is \u201Cthe social graph\u201D but again it\u2019s fairly closed. I\u2019d temper that last statement however to say that <a rel="nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Facebook Connect" href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> is a move towards becoming a more open, amorphous platform.</p>\u000A<p><strong>Pantheism</strong></p>\u000A<p>Pantheism is the view that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God. Without talking about the utility or otherwise of Twitter, it is the ultimate pantheistic example. To continue the pantheistic analogy, it is a platform that doesn\u2019t focus at all on the anthromorphic expression of itself, rather it\u2019s an abstract expression \u2013 the \u201Ctweet\u201D is a semi-abstract thing that takes on different shapes and forms at different times. The ecosystem that has built up around Twitter is phenomenal \u2013 this is precisely because it\u2019s a platform that doesn\u2019t dictate where players are or how they look. From this point of view Twitter is ultimately open. The critical mass they have is a little debatable looking at statistics of users who are actual active. Twitter\u2019s beachhead status is communication \u2013 often vacuous communication it must be admitted but communication nonetheless.</p>\u000A<p><strong>Co-operation</strong></p>\u000A<p>Co-operative platforms attempt to build critical mass through symbiosis. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thesmallbusinessweb.com/">The Small Business Web</a> is a good example of this. The Small Business Web, according to its founding partners</p>\u000A<blockquote><p>is a movement to bring together like-minded, customer-obsessed software companies to integrate our respective products and make life easier for small businesses. While there are many products available for small business owners on the Web, the approach we're taking is to use each others APIs to provide a high-level of integration between these applications and create a more seamless experience for our customers.</p>\u000A</blockquote>\u000A<p>In other words a bunch of small SaaS start-ups got together to try and build an alternative to the single site best-of-breed application. By working together on integrations, they\u2019re slowly build the ability for small businesses to pick and mix functionality according to their specific needs.</p>\u000A<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\u000A<p>Not eveyone can be a platform, but everyone sure wants to be. I\u2019d be keen to hear readers thoughts about this post and how they see the platform battles shaking down over the next year or two.</p>\u000A</p>\u000A</p>\u000A</p>\u000A</p>\u000A</p>\u000A</p>\u000A<div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=ca115cd6-3023-43ec-b886-34617f302ce2" /></div>\u000A<div align="right"><font size="1" color="#868686">CloudAve is exclusively sponsored by </font><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zoho.com"><img src="http://www.cloudave.com/images/zoho.png" align="absmiddle" border="0px" /></a></div>\u000A<div class="feedflare">\u000A<a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?a=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:YwkR-u9nhCs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?d=YwkR-u9nhCs" border="0" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?a=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?i=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?a=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?i=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?a=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?a=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:3QFJfmc7Om4"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CloudAve?i=vQ5YqkZYwDg:m8OHrlCp_KY:3QFJfmc7Om4" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div>\u000A<p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CloudAve/~4/vQ5YqkZYwDg" height="1" width="1" /></p>

VI have been a techno recluse for the last few months and I know that a few of you might have been wondering where I disappeared to. Well, I can tell you now that I have been through a very frustrating time. <br /><br />In July I was made redundant from my very short lived role of Brand Manager at Renaissance Brands. I don't consider myself a vicitim but more of a casualty of the current economic climate. I was employed to bring on the 'next big thing', an investment for the future; unfortunately I quickly became an expensive liability. The digital Freeview PVR was going to be the hero product but the TVNZ TiVo announcement gave Renaissance management cold feet so the project was dumped. We had actually signed an agreement with Magic TV which I thought was an excellent product regardless of TiVo. It is good see that freeviewshop has picked up the product.<br /><br />Fortunately money has not been an issue for us, well not yet anyway. But we have had to change our lifestyle slightly. For the first 2 months of unemployment I worked on our house during what was apparently the worst Wellington Winter in 30 years and I managed to paint the house inside and out. Quite a feat when you consider that we hang off a hill and the scaffolding was 30 meters high! I even painted the roof which is probably one of the scariest things I have done. All the work paid off as we sold our house in 7 days and at a good price. In the next 4 weeks we are dramactically downsizing. Moving from our modern, 3 storey house in central Wellington with the hell harbour view to a little 2 bedroom old house in the Hutt hills. Fortunately we have this option, the house in the Hutt is our rental property which we have owned for a number of years but it will be a shock to the system none the less.<br /><br />I have seriously lost count of how many jobs I have applied for; sometimes your application is acknowledged, sometimes not. Sometimes you get to meet with a recruitment consultant and sometimes you get an interview with the employer. All very frustrating and how the market has changed. Probably 2 years ago it was a job hunters&nbsp;market, loads of jobs and too few&nbsp;applicants and now it is exactly the opposite. It is a lengthy process as well; one position I applied for dragged on for 8 weeks from initial application to interview to not being successful and I really, really liked the role.<br /><br />After 20 odd years working at the cutting edge of technology in a variety of roles I have started to consider other options and have been looking at purchasing an exisiting business. It is possible that to secure a financial future for my family I may have to buy myself a job. Not necessarily where I want to be but I know my wife has probably had enough of me being at home. On the positive side though I have been able to spend lots of time with my 4 year old son and we are good mates. I know he doesn't want me to go back to work.<br /><br /><br />

V<b>&nbsp;Vinyl flashback #1 - P-Money</b><br />\u000A&nbsp;I recently had a discussion online with a bunch of Auckland music folk, about record shops we remember going to when we first started buying records. Various names popped up, like Rock N Roll Records, Record Warehouse, Revival Records and others.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AIt got me thinking, and I decided to start a new series on my blog, talking with local music fans about some of their favorite memories of record shopping, and of fave records and where they found them. First up, I was lucky enough to get <b>P-Money</b> to talk about some of his formative record shopping&nbsp; experiences. P-Money is currently winging round the UK as part of Zane Lowe's DJ tour and doing very well for himself. Enjoy his vinyl tales. Thanks for your time. Pete!<br />\u000A(P-Money's <a href="http://pmoneymusic.blogspot.com/">blog</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/pmoneymusic">myspace </a>pages)<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<b><br />\u000A</b><br />\u000A<b>What was the first record shop you remember going to?</b><br />\u000AThere was some little store, I must have been about 7 years old, maybe younger, [I went] with my dad - he had a shop in the main street in Papakura and he knew all the shopkeepers in town. We'd go in there to buy whatever was out, I guess, and my parents were buying music. But I remember that Woolworths had records in it, when it was a department store before it was just a supermarket.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ABut the first one that I frequented to buy my own stuff, was when I was a bit older, probably 12 or 13, and it was one of the Sounds chain, the Papakura store, where I grew up, and then it changed into Truetone. I used to buy records from there. I got this, one, BDP, from there, cos they used to have clearance [bins].<br />\u000A<br />\u000AMy friend, Toni Cooper, he used to work there, and I think they would order records they knew weren't gonna sell, so they could mark them down and buy them cheap! They had so many copies of this album, and I swear that nobody in town even knew what it was, and they marked it down to three bucks for me. Cos I had no money, I'm like a little kid [then].I used to go in there after school every day and just look at the records, and look thru the clearance bins and whatever was in my range, if it was under five bucks, I'd snap it up.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ASo they'd mark things down , \u201CMake that three dollars, man, make that seven\u201D, and I was like, ah, I can get that. \u2026 I think albums back then were about $15 to $18, maybe $20 for imported things. So three bucks was a score.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThe first big store that I remember was Real Groovy. I'd heard about, cos I didn't grow up in the city, so I didn't know about the bigger stores they had in town, all I knew was my little local one. My friend came back from town, and he had, like, an Ice Cube album on vinyl, and the Source magazine. I was like \u201Cwhere did you get these things?\u201D cos they weren't in my local record shop. He was like \u201CReal Groovy\u201D and I had this vision of this magical place that had everything that I wanted.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI finally made the trip, I took the train, 45 minutes on the train, walked all the way uptown from the town station, finally found the place, and it's this massive store, and it's so big, and I just couldn't believe it. And I didn't have much money, and I could only afford one record and it's this one...<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<div class="separator"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssMnttISsI/AAAAAAAAAG4/4Unainab8yw/s1600-h/DSC00759+UBB1.JPG"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssMnttISsI/AAAAAAAAAG4/4Unainab8yw/s400/DSC00759+UBB1.JPG" /></a><br />\u000A</div><br />\u000A<br />\u000A<b>Ultimate breaks and beats</b> compilation. This is number nine. Because I had read about this compilation in the <i>Face</i> magazine, cos my art teacher gave it to me in art class, and it had an article on the producers Marley Marl, and Hurby Lovebug \u2013 he was producing Salt N Pepa, and I read the article and they mentioned that series of records, and they were saying it's easy to get the breakbeats now because they're all on these complilations. So I knew of it, but I'd never seen it.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI was sifting thru Real Groovy, and I found it, and thought this is the record they're talking about. So I bought it, of course I only had one copy, and took it home and didn't really know what to do with it. Five seconds of the music is really good, and the rest is crap.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ABut then I learnt about breakbeats thru finding the record, that what flicked the switch for me, like, "right, so there's random songs that have really cool parts that you can sample and loop up and make hiphop songs", which just opened my brain up again. Like, okay, now maybe I can find these on any record, I don't have to buy the compilation, I can find the originals.<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<div class="separator"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssO3SlKpTI/AAAAAAAAAHA/-qFOXWehDQA/s1600-h/DSC00759+UBB1cu.JPG"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssO3SlKpTI/AAAAAAAAAHA/-qFOXWehDQA/s400/DSC00759+UBB1cu.JPG" /></a><br />\u000A</div><br />\u000A<br />\u000AI went back numerous times after that, of course,.. I'd rock up to the second hand desk and just talk with those guys, and every now and then I'd bring in promos that I got sent I didn't want any more and trade them and pick up a bunch of records. There was definitely a rapport, but I had that more with my local store. Especially growing up, all thru my teens, I'd be there every day after school. They didn't have a huge vinyl selection, but I'd order in things that I knew about, and they'd get me my twelve inches and double copies of things that I needed to DJ with.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AMy friend Kersham, our whole friendship was based around that record store. He used to work there and I would see him every day. To me, as a kid, he had this huge knowledge of music, which I didn't have that, and I learnt from him, and I learnt from Toni \u2013 he gave me the first Public Enemy album, Bumrush The Show. They're like my favourite group of all time. Toni said to me you can borrow this \u2013 this is mine, but take it home and have a listen to it, I think you'll really like it\u201D. I was blown away. I was like \u201Cwow!\u201D, and from then I was sold on them.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI ended up working in the store for a while as well, for school holidays. I would do stuff like wash the windows, just so they could give me like a free album and stuff. Its funny how it all connects, cos it was Peter Farnon - he started Beat Merchants \u2013 he was general manager of Trutone and he came to visit the Papakura store, when I was cleaning the windows, and so he gave me the records, and couple of years later when he opened Beat Merchants, I was a regular customer there. That was another store that I frequented a lot.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AWith Groovy it was like, cool this is an outlet where I can get the information that I need, not just the music, but the added benefit of being able to get all these records and put the pieces of the puzzle together, and they had books and magazines as well.<br />\u000A<i><br />\u000A</i><br />\u000A<b><br />\u000A</b><br />\u000A<b>What about when you started getting some overseas trips and hitting up record stores?</b><br />\u000A<br />\u000ABeat Street in Brooklyn was like Mecca. I couldn't believe it when I first walked in there. The space was not that big, like Groovy, much much smaller, but just dense with stock, so many records. And I'd never seen so many copies of each release, whether it was the latest thing or a reissue, like an old EPMD 12 inch, they've got 20 copies, sitting there, so people can come in and just pick up doubles, whereas here, you;d be lucky to find one, let alone two.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThe price used to trip me out. When I went, they were averaging about $5 US for a 12 inch. So I could get two, for less than the price of buying one here - $25 for one 12 inch single. So would just go mad. And i was coming back with like a crate of records, maybe 80 records. That's 23 kilos of extra baggage. You have to pay for it!<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI was doing all kinds of tricks, I had a back pack full of maybe 30, 40 records, I could fit as many in there without it looking like I had this really heavy thing on my back, so I'm trying to stand up real straight, like its not straining, me, and then I've got plastic shopping bags either aside, with another 20 records in each one, so I'm physically carrying about 20 kilos on me, plus I got the 20 kilos in my luggage, and you just do whatever you can to get it home without paying excess baggage.<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<div class="separator"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssPVglGC7I/AAAAAAAAAHQ/XhtCDaxC8Sk/s1600-h/DSC00760+HAYES1cu.JPG"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssPVglGC7I/AAAAAAAAAHQ/XhtCDaxC8Sk/s400/DSC00760+HAYES1cu.JPG" /></a><br />\u000A</div><br />\u000A<br />\u000ABeat Street had a DJ in the store too, who would be playing all the latest stuff. So instead of having to go and ask to hear a record, hes already playing it. And then you're hearing thing s you might not have picked up off the shelf. Its a really great environment. You rub shoulders with other DJs and music fans, which is a huge thing I miss, and I think .<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThat's the biggest downside - I'm not so sentimental about physical vinyl, but the community aspect of DJs and music fans all convening at one spot, cos they know all the new records have just dropped, and they're all discussing the recent finds, what they're looking forward to, and a real face to face human interaction and getting a vibe for records and it made certain songs more special amongst communities, or in my experience, where as now you can still discuss things with a much broader group of people online, it is the same kind of thing, but you re not actually in the presence of those people.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThat's one of the greatest things about record stores \u2013 I used to love going there when I had no money, to hang out with the clerks selling the records, or the other guys who were buying things. I'd be in the record store 3,4, 5 hours just to socialise. And I'm listening to every record in the store getting vast knowledge of music, and I'm putting stuff aside when I have some money, and that's just gone. Its completely gone. So I am sentimental about that, the experience.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AIt used to be a hangout, especially Best Merchants in the city, for me, and my scene, around like, 99 to 2002. That was a really good time for hiphop music in general, with good record coming out, cool indie labels like Rawkus and similar, were consistently dropping good records.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AThere were a lot of DJs that were involved in scratching and the turntablist thing was going on, and the store was like a hub. You had Sirvere [Phil Bell] ordering all the latest stuff, making sure we're as up to date as possible , even tho we're this far from where the records are being made. I've still got tons of friends from those years.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI love the convenience of being able to get online and at the very least being able to stream any song I can think of, even if I cant find the file to download. I'm talking about rare things that you think nobody else knew about, and you can find it on youtube!<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<div class="separator"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssPI1N4ApI/AAAAAAAAAHI/4fQEL078S-Y/s1600-h/DSC00760+HAYES1.JPG"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7352q37VRgM/SssPI1N4ApI/AAAAAAAAAHI/4fQEL078S-Y/s400/DSC00760+HAYES1.JPG" /></a><br />\u000A</div><br />\u000AThe other store I really used to like -cos I used to think of Real Groovy as your mainstream, obvious, record store \u2013 if you wanted to dig for records, you could go there and find cool stuff, but everyone else is there too, and not so far off the beaten track was the Record Exchange on K Rd. For some reason, to me that felt like thats where you go if you really know whats up, for digging for records. I really enjoyed that place when it was open, when it was in St Kevins Arcade, and then it moved to 123 K Rd.<br />\u000A<br />\u000AI remember the first time I discovered that place; it was upstairs there. It was a reasonably small room, and no-one had told me about it -I just saw this sign on the street and wandered up there, this dusty-as place, and it kind of felt \u2013 and I might be wrong and forgive me if I got the wrong impression - but I kind of felt a little bit of snobbishness from the staff there, kinda looking down their nose, like you don't know anything about music\u201D, which was definitely common amongst many record stores.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ASome staff were great, very open about their knowledge of music, others were like \u201CThis is just for me, you have to earn my respect in order for me to share my information\u201D. It was all part of the fun really. But I felt a little bit intimidated in there, I didn't know enough about music, but I liked what I was seeing when I was digging thru their records. <br />\u000A<br />\u000AI discovered my love for Isaac Hayes there. The To Be Continued album, I found that in there. All I knew of Isaac Hayes at that point was the Shaft soundtrack. But that record just looked really interesting, the cover, his face. I just thought it looked really cool. So I bought the record, took a chance on it, bought it home, and I heard Ikes Mood, on side two \u2013 it's an amazing record, for a start \u2013 and it's got the little piano breakdown which has been used countless times in hiphop songs, but I didn't know it was from there.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ASo it was like \u201CWow, I found this break that other people have used\u201D, so I went back to get every Isaac Hayes album I could find. Cos I loved the music -let alone the novelty of someone had sampled it \u2013 but the music itself really spoke to me.<br />\u000A<br />\u000ARecord Exchange was the spot \u2013 they had a good selection of Isaac albums at the time, so I cleaned them out. And then a couple of years later, they had reissues in Beat Merchants, for like $40, $50, and I was like, I picked all these up for under 8 bucks, sweet! It's all timing with records too.<br />\u000A<br />\u000A<b>Now, go read <a href="http://dubdotdash.blogspot.com/2009/10/vinyl-flashbacks-p-money-part-2-in-part.html">PART TWO</a>.</b><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5726812-7270766474043636202?l=dubdotdash.blogspot.com" /></div>

V<p>Economies change. The pattern and places of jobs shift.  Voters demand  politicians do something about it. Regional development programmes are often part of the political response, and many start to offer tax breaks, employment subsidies, building subsidies and so on.  It sounds good, it looks like action, and (I'm being unfairly cynical here) no politician hangs around long enough to be accountable for the almost inevitable lack of success.</p>\u000A<p>It gets worse when you have regions in the same economy competing with similar programmes.  It just escalates into an arms-race of who offers the biggest subsidies.  Britain has a particularly bad case of regional subsidies.  In a country full of property investors and  businesses,  it's amazing that its seven regional economic <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8325116.stm" title="BBC" target="_blank">development agencies build business parks</a>, often in areas away from where business is or wants to be.  Bangor, a small university town in remote north-west Wales, has got one.  It's been empty for years.  To throw good taxpayer money after bad, they've built another one 20 miles down the road at Holyhead!</p>\u000A<p>Here's a simple test. If it was your money, would you invest in a speculative large-scale commercial property investment in a remote small town.  Of course you wouldn't.  So why should the taxpayer? Here's another simple test.  Would this business operate in this town/region/country without this subsidy?  Why will it stay long term?  No-one in their right mind would have built a major computer factory in Ireland (2 sea journeys away from mainland Europe) if it hadn't been for the then-cheap labour, EU subsidies and Irish tax breaks.  So it should have been no surprise when Dell announced it will close its subsidised Irish factories and move to Poland.  The <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article5472924.ece" title="Times" target="_blank">Poles simply offered Dell a better proposition than the Irish</a>.</p>\u000A<p>Is there any developed country with  regional economy development subsidies which has achieved sustained economic well-being <strong>that wouldn't have happened anyway?</strong> Ah, I hear, what about Singapore?  Singapore is the exception that proves the rule, and that's the point; it is an exception, a small city-state sitting at the hub of a key trade route, with no hinterland to worry about, and a collective will which allows it to act more like an industrial conglomerate than a country. For the rest of us, all the evidence shows that the market will determine what long-term industries you have, and where they will locate. All governments can usefully do is facilitate underlying factor conditions such as infrastructure, education, regulation and taxation frameworks, etc..  After that, like it or lump it, it's all up to individual businesses.</p>\u000A<p>None of which will  stop voters demanding that "<em>the gumment must do something</em>" and politicians saying "<em>we will</em>".</p>\u000A<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was a non-executive board member of 2 regional economic development agencies in NZ. We didn't do subsidies; we did try (not always successfully) to address factor conditions.  </em></p>\u000A<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JDEnAvant/~4/uMBp0403_Pw" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>As we get further into spring, not only do we get outdoors more, and at the same time the outdoor fauna becomes more active. </p>\u000A\u000A	<p>For example, the House Hoppers are becoming more active on the outside of the house, and I caught both a male and this <em>very</em> beautiful female, surely as pulchritudinous as some cartoon representation of a homely, anthropomorphic spider:</p>\u000A\u000A<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dubh/4046218386/" title="House Hopper (female) by dubh, on Flickr"><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/4046218386_e17c966817.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="House Hopper (female)" /></a></p>\u000A\u000A	<p>The male was a cheeky wee chappie, like all his jumping spider kin - they remain <a href="http://halfpie.net/article/688/why-salticidae-is-my-favourite">my favourite</a> kind of spider. I'm assuming he was a "he", and of the same species, but I'm just not sure. His legs were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dubh/4046218114/">much stripier</a>, but I'm not enough of an arachnologist to have any idea what to look for.</p>\u000A\u000A	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dubh/4046219148/" title="Tunnelweb spider (female) by dubh, on Flickr"><img align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2600/4046219148_47aab0a672_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Tunnelweb spider (female)" /></a>Not so pretty was the large female tunnelweb spider Rebecca found under a sack of bark chips that had been undisturbed since last summer. </p>\u000A\u000A	<p>These are very common around our house; the most pleasing thing about them is that they are not wanderers and are seldom seen inside. However they are very large, from head to end about three centimeters not including the legs, and I never like being surprised by them when I'm in the garden. It is said they have a reasonable bite on them too, though I am not very willing to test it.</p>\u000A\u000A	<p>In my last posting, on the mantis hatchlings, I mentioned the large black-armed jumping spider we had inside. I took it outside in case we get any more hatchlings overnight tonight.</p>\u000A\u000A	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dubh/4046219462/" title="Black-armed jumping spider (male) by dubh, on Flickr"><img align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2588/4046219462_debed75d76_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Black-armed jumping spider (male)" /></a>These, particularly the males, are common inside during the warmer months (and their cousins, a smaller brown stripy species, seem to be year-round indoor visitors). With their binocular vision they do like to turn to face objects of interest, which allows us to anthropomorphise their actions to a shameful degree. But whatever - these are cool spiders.</p>\u000A\u000A	<p>No doubt I'll be taking more photos over summer, particularly on sunny days when I have a decent amount of light. You have been warned.</p>\u000A<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/halfpie/~4/i7S5yYBCCeI" height="1" width="1" />

The show itself was pretty cool with lots of new songs and a fair mix of the hits (old and new) with a mighty <a href="http://www.allu2songslyrics.com/2009/08/until-end-of-world-lyrics-u2.html">Until the End of the World </a>being a highlight for me. Unknown Caller was pretty darn good too.<div><br /></div><div>The technical side of things must have been a production in itself. The stream I had was perfect with good sound quality and minimal buffering required. There were 100,000 LA fans present - how many million were tuned in via youtube I dunno but google/youtube's servers must have served terrabytes and terrabytes of data!</div><div><br /></div><div>The U2 show was a first in many ways - there have been plenty of live broadcasts before but this one is on a massive scale using some of the leading technology. </div><div><br /></div><div>This means it was probably a branding exercise for Youtube. How many fans who have never used Youtube suddenly found out all about the website after coming to watch the concert? (I realise youtube is huge but I'm sure some people have never heard of it?)</div><div><br /></div><div>It also works for <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2</a> as well - one could by the new album via a link on the channel which took the follower to U2's Itunes sales medium.</div><div><br /></div><div>So has this concert changed the content model? Will people be more content to sit at home and watch Bono preach at them on their 40 inch tv? Probably not, but more people might be inclined to tune in and follow their fave artists tour. Time will tell - look for what happens when the Rolling Stones tour next!</div><div><br /></div><div>Major world events etc can also be used in this medium. Streamed Olympic Games anyone? Meetings of world leaders? When the aliens finally land? and the obvious - movie and television shows. </div><div><br /></div>TV execs and the like must be quietly crapping their pants as they watched - here was premium content being delivered for free with bugger all adverting. Facebook had a little look in....there were no adds during the broadcast at all.  HBO suddely becomes a little redundant when the next Sopranos is shown via the internet only eh?<div><div><div><br /></div><div>Chat to <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmyjangles">Jimmy Jangles on Twitter</a>!</div></div></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9014812-376908277514072600?l=www.theoptimusprimeexperiment.com" /></div>

V<p>While buzzing around Courtenay Place recently, I noticed that the Sports Caf&eacute; was closed for renovations. A sign said something like &quot;Don't worry&quot; (and I didn't) &quot;we'll be back with a new bar soon&quot;. My antennae perked up at that: could this prominent corner soon be home to something new, something shiny, something (not to put too fine a point on it) that's not the Sports Caf&eacute;?</p>\u000A<p>Then I spotted an email address on the sign, one that ended in &quot;<a href="http://saints.co.nz/page/home.aspx">saints.co.nz</a>&quot;. That's the website for the local Saints basketball team, so some sort of sports-related bar seemed likely. What's more, the Saints are officially &quot;The Century City Saints&quot;, since they are sponsored by <a href="http://www.centurycity.co.nz/">Century City Developments</a>. That company is owned by a certain Mr Serepisos, who also happens to have owned the first bar on this site: and what a many-splendoured thing Ecstasy Plus was, back when I was just a larva.</p>\u000A<p>So, gentle readers, what do you know about this place? Will it be a basketball-themed bar? A return to the glitzarama of the early 90s? Or some unholy combination of the two?</p>

V<p>The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/opinion/editorials/3000507/Editorial-Democracy-must-not-silence-views">Dom Post Editorial</a>:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Few things are more abhorrent than the extreme Right and those who perpetuate its thuggish philosophies.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I always wonder why they are called extreme right, as invariably such groups support protectionism and left-wing economic policies. Take the BNP whose economic policies are:</p>\u000A<ul>\u000A<li>anti foreign investment</li>\u000A<li>wants the subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government</li>\u000A<li>self sufficiency in food production</li>\u000A<li>is critical of corporatism and big capitalism</li>\u000A<li>seeks to reduce income inequality</li>\u000A</ul>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>The arrival in the Hutt Valley of supporters of the far-Right National Front, Right wing Resistance and New Zealand Nationalist Alliance at the weekend is only slightly more concerning. With their truncated version of the Nazi symbol, skinheads and their sparsely-attended parade through Wellington's streets, they succeeded only in demonstrating they are inconsequential and have no support in New Zealand.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>True.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>An anti-racism campaigner was appalled that a holiday park allowed the groups to stay. However, the alternative \u2013 allowing discrimination on the grounds of political belief \u2013 would not only be illegal, it would also be a difficult concept for many New Zealanders to swallow.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>There is a sensible middle group. Don't discriminate on the basis of membership or belief, but hell if I owned a holiday park, and you started waving a swastika about, you'd be gone.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>More difficult to resolve is the debate raging in Britain over whether British National Party leader Nick Griffin should have been given a slot on the BBC's Question Time programme. Those who believe he should not, argue that it gave his whites-only party an undeserved aura of political respectability. They claim 3000 expressed interest in joining the party just before and after the appearance.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>BBC bosses argue that, as a state broadcaster, the corporation has to cover all political parties with a national presence \u2013 something it judges the BNP to have achieved because, though it has no MPs at Westminster, in European parliamentary elections this year it won two seats with just under a million votes.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>The BBC is right in principle and in practice. A principled democracy cannot simply silence views that the majority disagree with.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Absolutely.  And a state broadcaster especially must not censor minority views.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>In practice, Mr Griffin's appearance has simply revealed his politics for the illogical farrago of prejudices they are. He floundered over whether he denied the Holocaust had taken place and defended the Ku Klux Klan as "almost totally non-violent".</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Griffin tries to pretend that he is now merely a defended of indigenous Brits. He is a former National Front member (he joined at age 14) and not only is he a Holocaust denier, he even criticised David Irving for admitting the number of Jews who died may be up to four million. He has also praised the Waffen SS and ironically attacked the RAF for its bombing of Nazi Germany.</p>\u000A<p>He has also attempted to form an Alliance with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini!</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>There is no room for complacency about those who preach the politics of hate, but the way to deal with them is to confront them and expose their policies to the unblinking light of reason. The alternative \u2013 pretending they do not exist \u2013 simply feeds their conspiracy theories and allows their distortions to grow unchallenged.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Again - I agree. One reason I publish regular updates on the National Front and its various splinter groups.</p>\u000A\u000A	Tags: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/bnp" title="BNP" rel="tag">BNP</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/dominion_post" title="Dominion Post" rel="tag">Dominion Post</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/free_speech" title="free speech" rel="tag">free speech</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/national_front" title="National Front" rel="tag">National Front</a><br />

There is no deductions for marketing, admin, political lobbying or the like. In fact not even the cost of the telegraphic transfer is taken out of the appeal funds.</li>\u000A<li>The International Red Cross also does not deduct a cent for its own administration. The IRC (actually several bodies) funds it administration directly from grants from parties to the Geneva Conventions, foundations and member red cross societies. So every dollar earmarked for an appeal, is actually spent directly on field operations.</li>\u000A<li>The Red Cross has presence in 186 countries - basically every country on Earth. This means it doesn't generally hand money over to Governments to spend, but they spend it themselves  through the local Red Cross (or Crescent) Society. This reduces corruption immensely. It also tends to mean a little money can go a long way, as the local red cross society tends to have extensive volunteer networks.</li>\u000A<li>The Red Cross doesn't discriminate as to whom it helps. It doesn't do politics. It doesn't try to convert people to a religion. It doesn't also operate as a left-wing lobby group.  The <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/what/values/principles/index.asp">seven fundamental principles</a> are why they are sometimes the only group allowed into war zones etc.</li>\u000A</ol>\u000A<p>There are many good charities out there (Save the Children Fund is also excellent) and they generally all do good work. But for me, when there is an international disaster I always donate to the Red Cross.</p>\u000A\u000A	Tags: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/overseas_aid" title="overseas aid" rel="tag">overseas aid</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/red_cross" title="Red Cross" rel="tag">Red Cross</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/samoa" title="Samoa" rel="tag">Samoa</a><br />

It tends to be used for tax bills only, and means the House sits without pause (except meal breaks) until the bills covered by the extraordinary urgency are passed.</li>\u000A<li>Urgency to pass a bill through multiple stages. This is when the House goes into urgency (which means longer sitting houses) to pass a bill through all stages, without referring it to a select committee. This is generally quite undesirable as bypassing select committee both robs the public of a chance to submit, but also means drafting flaws are less likely to be corrected.</li>\u000A<li>Normal urgency. This extends the sitting hours of the House, and effectively cancels question time, but bills do not generally go through more than one stage at a time.</li>\u000A<li>Urgency with question time.This is when the Government goes into urgency to extend the sitting hours, but modifies it so the House can still have question time every day. This reflects the importance of the Opposition being able to hold the Government to account through question time.</li>\u000A</ol>\u000A<p>Now a lot of people don't realise that the House normally sits  for relatively few hours each week. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays it sits from 2 until  6pm, then 7.30pm until 10pm. On Thursday it sits from 2pm until  6pm.</p>\u000A<p>That's 17.5 hours. That sounds like quite a bit of time  for the government to pass bills. But remember that Question Time happens each  day between 2pm and 3.15-3.30. On Wednesdays there is a general debate between  3.30 and 4.30. And every second Wednesday is a members' day, when the government  can't advance government business.</p>\u000A<p>All this means that in a normal week, the government gets  only around 12-13 hours (depending on how long Question Time lasts) to pass  Bills. Every second week it gets only 7.5 hours! I won't even get started on  urgent debates (granted by the speaker), motions of condolence, etc, all of  which take more time. Overall it tends to mean less than 10 hours a week on average to actually pass laws.</p>\u000A<p>Urgency means that the House extend its sitting times. From the day after the motion is moved (so Wednesday if moved on a Tuesday) the House sits from 9 am to midnight, which is 13 hours a day excluding meal breaks.</p>\u000A<p>In theory the House could sit until midnight Saturday, which would be 58.5 hours. In reality normally the House still rises on a Thursday, so the extra time gained is Wednesday and Thursday mornings plus Thursday evening.</p>\u000A<p>This is what the government has been doing lately - just extending the hours on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\u000A<p>The problem of lack of time to pass Bills is not one that has  just affected this government. That is why Labour is being totally hypocritical  over the use of urgency. Grant Robertson and Chris Hipkins in particular know  better given they were advisors to the last government. Dr Cullen regularly put  the House into urgency between 1999 and 2008 and a helpful reader has done the  numbers for me.</p>\u000A<p>In the 1999-2002 Parliament, Labour took urgency 22 times and  extraordinary urgency twice. 23 bills passed their 3rd reading under urgency.  Indeed in Labour's first year in office, they took urgency ten  times.</p>\u000A<p>In the 2002-2005 Parliament, Labour took urgency nineteen  times and a massive 78 Bills passed their 3rd reading under  urgency!</p>\u000A<p>In the 2005-2008 Parliament, Labour took urgency ten times  and 48 bills passed their 3rd reading under urgency.</p>\u000A<p>Urgency was often moved in October, November, and December of  each year under Labour, as the end of the year approached. That's what this  government appears to be doing as well. It's nothing to do with poor House management - it's simply extending sitting hours in the traditional pre-Xmas period.</p>\u000A<p>The other thing that I want to stress is that urgency normally  means question time is not held, how ever National has consistently arranged urgency so that  question time is still taken, ensuring Ministers remain accountable to the  House. This was very rare under Labour.</p>\u000A<p>I expect as the Parliamentary  term goes on the use of urgency will decline a bit. Further down the track the  government might like to take a look at the sitting hours and practices of the  House. Should the House sit regularly on Thursday night for example? Is there  potential to have the House sitting regularlyin the morning even while select committees  are considering Bills?</p>\u000A<p>Personally I would change Standing Orders also, to reflect the different types of urgency. I personally would not call merely extending the sitting hours "urgency" if question time (and members day) is retained. I would also look at whether the Speaker's permission might be needed for urgency which is used to bypass select committee, to make it harder for Governments to do so.</p>\u000A\u000A	Tags: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/grant_robertson" title="Grant Robertson" rel="tag">Grant Robertson</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/hypocrisy" title="hypocrisy" rel="tag">hypocrisy</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/standing_orders" title="Standing Orders" rel="tag">Standing Orders</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/urgency" title="urgency" rel="tag">urgency</a><br />

V<p>I've never met Peter Zohrab, but most people online in the 90s would have seen his posts on Usenet about the feminazis. Anyway, at the weekend I happened to be searching the NZPA database on my name (looking for an old article) and I saw an article with a quote about how I should be convicted for my comments re Clayton Weatherston.</p>\u000A<p>I thought I would recall such an article, so I opened it, and it turns out it was a press release (NZPA carry them if you pay for it) from a "PeterDouglas" which I am sure is abbreviated from Peter Douglas Zohrab.</p>\u000A<p>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/clayton-weatherston-witchhunt/5/20059">his press release</a> so much, I just had to share it.  The amazing thing is he turns up to select committees also, and uses much the same language. Extracts:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em><span>The female-dominated professions of Psychology ( http://equality.netfirms.com/ispsycho.html ) , Law ( http://equality.netfirms.com/islaws.html ) , and Journalism ( http://equality.netfirms.com/ismedia.html ) have generally very low standards of intelligence and non-existent standards of political objectivity. This no doubt results from being dominated by women who are more interested in people than in ideas, and who see a clitoro-centric universe as their Feminist birthright. </span></em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p><span>A clitoro-centric universe!</span></p>\u000A<p><span></p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Now, this Associate Professor of the scientific study of the human mind and its functions, especially those affecting behaviour in a given context finds it "hard to imagine" why a man would not act like a robot in an extremely stressful immediate context, which itself was the culmination of an extremely stressful ongoing context.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>This just reinforces my impression (from long and varied experience of them) that Western universities ( http://equality.netfirms.com/iseducat.html ) are little more than instruments for the fulfilment of Lesbian Feminist fantasies. It is impossible for men to do well in universities, when competence in man-hating is a prerequiste for achievement and promotion. Universities should all be abolished, the staff sacked, and the education system rethought from square one.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I'm curious as to what is a lesbian feminist fantasy, and you subscribe to it on Sky?</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em><span>Michael Laws is an honorary girl. Of course, he is - otherwise the female-dominated media wouldn't allow him to have a newspaper column.</span></em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p><span>Of course that is the reason!</span></p>\u000A<p></span></p>\u000A\u000A	Tags: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/peter_zohrab" title="Peter Zohrab" rel="tag">Peter Zohrab</a><br />

V<p>The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/2998130/Spotlight-to-fall-on-tax-dodgers">SST reports</a>:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>Finance minister Bill English has signalled the government will next year get tough with tax-dodgers by closing loopholes that allow wage earners to avoid paying their share of tax.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>The IRD says the government is missing out on $300 million a year because of wage earners who squirrel away money into trust accounts to avoid paying the top income tax rate. More is lost because of earnings that are "sheltered" by a company created solely to avoid tax.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Not sure how you can legislate to fix that.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>The IRD, in its latest submission to the Tax Working Group, says the problem is that New Zealand's multitude of tax rates is encouraging bad behaviour.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Oh I am sure it is.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>It said the trust account and company tax rates were too far out of line with income tax rates. Taxpayers were placing income in a trust account, paying 33 cents for every dollar earned, rather than the top rate of 38c. Another common ploy was for individual taxpayers to "shelter" their money by creating a company so that they paid 30 cents of every dollar earned in tax rather than the top rate.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>The preferred solution is to lower the top tax rate - in fact that is the Govt's official goal - to have a top tax rate of 30% for individuals, companies and trusts.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>The IRD says that when the top income tax rate of 39 cents (now 38 cents) was applied to earnings of $60,000+ in 2000, a flood of taxpayers rearranged their finances to avoid the new regime.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>I understand the number of people who declared they earned exactly $60,000 increased literally exponentially.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>English said large-scale "legitimate avoidance behaviour" by higher-income earners undermined the goodwill of lower-income earners.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>"It's quite telling that there has been virtually no growth in the number of people paying tax on $1 million of annual income, since the 39 cent top personal tax rate was introduced 10 years ago.</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>So reduce the incentives for avoidance and cut the top tax rate. When Muldoon's top tax rate of 66% was dropped to 33%, it killed off much of the avoidance industry. Cullen recreated it.</p>\u000A<p>Also some of the reason for no growth in people paying tax on a million dollars of income, is they have gone overseas.</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><em>"As a country, we want families, businesses, accountants and lawyers looking at how to unlock greater income and productivity, not working out how to minimise their tax.</em></p>\u000A<p><em>"We don't want people spending their time and resources trying to avoid tax. We also don't want IRD devoting all its time to chasing tax and compliance issues."</em></p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Then again drop the top tax rate!</p>\u000A\u000A	Tags: <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/ird" title="IRD" rel="tag">IRD</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/tax" title="tax" rel="tag">tax</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/tax_avoidance" title="tax avoidance" rel="tag">tax avoidance</a>, <a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/tax_cuts" title="tax cuts" rel="tag">tax cuts</a><br />

V<p>Next week I'm starting a new job. Off the PHP, back onto the C#. Off <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/">web</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">apps</a>, back onto <a href="http://www.comarchive.com">back-end server development</a>. Out of an office, into working at home, on my own (well, when <a href="http://blog.verdandi.co.nz/">Leonie</a> isn't at home anyway!). No more 5 days a week, I'm down to 4 now.</p>\u000A<p>All very different. All very familiar. I'm rather looking forward to it.</p>\u000A<p>Chances are, something worth writing will come out of it. My first focus is going to be on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, especially EC2 and the new <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Virtual Private Cloud</a> stuff they are doing. Second on the list (and for the same reason) is moving an existing SQL Server app to use both SQL Server and PostgreSQL. This isn't a one-off tho - I need to make a large application work with both databases going forward. It should be a nice exercise in refactoring and redesigning a working application. Quite different to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">PHP/Service/CouchDB web app</a>.</p>\u000A<p>First change for me is the working at home bit. I am trying to separate my workspace and my "non"-workspace, at least mentally. Rather than running a windows VM on my Macbook, I've put it on the Mac Mini, which is a faster machine (same CPU speed, double the front side bus speed), has more RAM (3GB vrs 4GB), but mostly, has NONE of the distractions (twitter, Google talk, browsers) that my Macbook has. There will only be two apps running on it - VMWare Fusion, and iTunes. It'll be as easy as moving to the other keyboard to get back to the Macbook, but it's an actual move, not just a context switch. Lets see how that goes.</p>\u000A<p>The Macbook isn't wasted tho - it'll be running a server VM which has Exchange, <a href="http://www.comarchive.com">ComArchive</a>, SQL Server and PostgreSQL on it.</p>\u000A<p>Then there is the issue of having a good coffee machine in the other room.... repeat after me, my new mantra: <strong>4 a day. only 4 a day</strong>.</p>\u000A<div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?a=4KPYjQMFjck:6HvBlcWm-y0:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?a=4KPYjQMFjck:6HvBlcWm-y0:7Q72WNTAKBA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?d=7Q72WNTAKBA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?a=4KPYjQMFjck:6HvBlcWm-y0:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheChickenCoop?i=4KPYjQMFjck:6HvBlcWm-y0:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheChickenCoop/~4/4KPYjQMFjck" height="1" width="1" />

While I think it\u2019s great people are using ironruby and cucumber, the guide you can find on aslak\u2019s github wiki isn\u2019t the most ideal solution as it will&#160; only work for windows and it requires MRI to be installed on your system.&#160; So I thought I\u2019d write up how I\u2019ve been creating launchers that work both on windows .NET and mono systems.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>Another problem the approach of setting the GEM_PATH to the MRI gem location is that if your gem requires a C-extension (which could easily be a C# extension in IronRuby) ruby will get confused about which one it\u2019s going to need.</p>\u000A\u000A<p>I\u2019m going to use cucumber as an example but this counts for most ruby libraries. I\u2019ve been using this for a few months already so it really doesn\u2019t matter which version of IronRuby you\u2019ve got installed. I\u2019ve compiled a fresh version from github and deployed that to C:\u005Cironruby on windows and added C:\u005Cironruby\u005Cbin to my PATH environment variable. I installed my ironruby version on my *nix boxes in /usr/local/ironruby and added /usr/local/ironruby/bin, /usr/local/ironruby/silverlight/bin and /usr/local/ironruby/silverlight/scripts to my PATH environment variable.</p>\u000A\u000A<h5>1. install the gem: igem install rspec cucumber -no-rdoc -no-ri</h5>\u000A\u000A<p>this will install the rspec and cucumber gems with their dependencies. And the gems process will actually install the launcher scripts in C:\u005Cironruby\u005Clib\u005Cironruby\u005Cgems\u005C1.8\u005Cbin and we\u2019re going to use those scripts to create our launcher script</p>\u000A\u000A<h5>2. Get the launcher scripts into the bin dir</h5>\u000A\u000A<p>On windows you can now go:</p>\u000A\u000A<pre>copy C:\u005Cironruby\u005Clib\u005Cironruby\u005Cgems\u005C1.8\u005Cbin\u005Ccucumber C:\u005Cironruby\u005Cbin\u005Cicucumber\u000Acopy C:\u005Cironruby\u005Clib\u005Cironruby\u005Cgems\u005C1.8\u005Cbin\u005Ccucumber.bat C:\u005Cironruby\u005Cbin\u005Cicucumber.bat</pre>\u000A\u000A<p>NTFS supports symlinks so you could also use the junction tool from the sysinternals toolkit to create those instead of copying the files. <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx</a></p>\u000A\u000A<p>On *nix based systems there is one more step to go through.</p>\u000A\u000A<pre><strike>cp /usr/local/ironruby/lib/IronRuby/gems/1.8/bin/cucumber /usr/local/ironruby/bin/\u000Amv /usr/local/ironruby/bin/cucumber /usr/local/ironruby/bin/icucumber</span></strike>\u000Acp /usr/local/ironruby/lib/IronRuby/gems/1.8/bin/cucumber /usr/local/ironruby/bin/icucumber\u000Achmod +x /usr/local/ironruby/bin/icucumber</pre>\u000A\u000A<p>And this is the easier way to properly use installed gems from the ironruby distribution, it will also make it a lot easier to upgrade your gems in 2 different ruby installations at different times etc.</p>\u000A<div class="feedflare">\u000A<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?a=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?a=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:7Q72WNTAKBA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?d=7Q72WNTAKBA" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?a=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?i=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?a=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?a=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/casualjim?i=1Hei_XkM_WM:WSx6FxmdG1A:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0" /></a>\u000A</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/casualjim/~4/1Hei_XkM_WM" height="1" width="1" />

V<p>We have previously looked at <a href="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/2009/09/a-future-of-on-line-finance-from-brokers-to-blogs-to-yahoo/">a view of the future of on-line finance</a>. In that analysis we looked a range of scenarios:</p>\u000A<p><a href="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/new-picture-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-921" title="new-picture-1" src="http://blog.valuecruncher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/new-picture-1-635x377.png" alt="new-picture-1" width="635" height="377" /></a></p>\u000A<p>One of the scenarios being Rock Stars.  We described the Rock Star scenario as:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p><span lang="EN-NZ"><strong>Rock Stars</strong> \u2013 Retail investors seek advice from communities of other investors and are willing to pay.<span> </span>Investors make their trading accounts transparent on-line. Successful investors open their accounts to act as virtual fund managers. Virtual fund managers and community owners split a management fee paid by investors.<span> </span><strong>Winners</strong> \u2013 <a href="http://www.covestor.com/">Covestor</a>, <a href="http://www.kaching.com/kaching#home">KaChing</a>.</span></p></blockquote>\u000A<p><span lang="EN-NZ">Last week <a href="http://twitter.com/kaChingInc">Dan Carroll</a> and the team at KaChing announced their new offering - and started to show how this scenario may play out. There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/technology/start-ups/19kaching.html?_r=1&ref=business">feature in the NY Times</a> which described the business model.<br />\u000A</span></p>\u000A<blockquote><p>Customers will be able to open a brokerage account with Interactive Brokers and link their account with their choice of investors on KaChing. KaChing charges customers a single management fee of 0.25 percent to 3 percent, set by each investor. KaChing keeps a quarter of the fee, and the investors get the rest.</p>\u000A<p>Each time the investors make a trade, KaChing will automatically make the same trades for the customer. Customers can log on whenever they want to check their portfolio\u2019s performance. They can send the investor private messages and receive alerts if the investor does something unusual. With the click of a mouse, customers can stop mirroring an investor.</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>KaChing has an <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaching">A-list team of investors</a> behind them. The on-line finance space has a lot of interesting experiments going on - but we think this is a particularly interesting one. A lot of us will be watching closely how KaChing goes.</p>\u000A<p>Disclosure: I met Dan and Jonathan from KaChing at the FinovateStartup09 event in San Francisco in April 2009. We had the stand next door. Good guys, smart guys - doing interesting things.</p>

They're going to have to look seriously at everything they do...(there's) a lot of departments that are no particular use to the country.</p>\u000A<p>SP: Could you name some?</p>\u000A<p>FF:  I can't um...there's all these departments that tell you what you can't do rather than what you can do...you know...</p>\u000A<p>SP: Could you name just a couple of those for us?</p>\u000A<p>FF: Well it's probably quite difficult....</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>Mr York then lights upon a new MAF scheme to trace and identify livestock as an 'illogical' spend (I'm guessing this has something to do with the country of origin in food debate)  but finally hits his stride with what's really causing all this trouble for the economy - welfare.</p>\u000A<p>To be honest, I've come to expect a little bit more from Fed Farmers in recent years.  But at least they're providing comic relief.</p>

We're above that limit and we're climbing fast.  <a href="http://www.350.org.nz/">350 Aotearoa</a> is the New Zealand arm of <a href="http://www.350.org/">350.org</a>, an international campaign dedicated to creating an equitable global climate treaty that lowers carbon dioxide below 350 parts per million.</p>\u000A<p>Last Saturday (24 October) was a global <a href="http://www.350.org/actions">Day of Action</a>, the "Most widespread day of political action in history".  There were 5,248 events in 181 countries, <a href="http://www.350.org.nz/actions/overview">110 of them</a> in New Zealand alone.  Tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people took part.  Check out some of the images from the NZ events <a href="http://www.thestandard.org.nz/feed/">here</a>.</p>\u000A<p>Internationally the media coverage wasn't bad.  It made the front page of the <a href="http://www.350.org/about/blogs/350-front-page-new-york-times">New York Times</a>, made the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2009/10/24/GA2009102402498.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20091025/wl_asia_afp/environmentclimatewarmingaction">news sites</a>, and so on.</p>\u000A<p>Here the coverage had some notable gaps.  There was a piece in the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/2999203/Shaping-the-future">Dominion Post</a>, a piece in the <a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/79551/dunedin-embraces-climate-action-day">Otago Daily Times</a>.  <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2009/10/24/1245ce5bf01c">Radio NZ</a> and <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/NZ-kicks-off-worldwide-series-of-events-in-fight-against-climate-change/tabid/992/articleID/126778/cat/64/Default.aspx">TV3</a> covered it.  But I can't find anything (maybe something I missed, I don't think there was anything prominent!) in The Herald, on TV1, or many of the newspapers.</p>\u000A<p>So those media outlets that didn't cover it - what's up folks?  They made it easy for you, here's the <a href="http://www.350.org/media">press kit</a>.  This was a major international event to highlight the greatest global threat faced by humanity, and it wasn't important enough to cover?  Didn't warrant a brief interruption to the usual diet of celebrity gossip and shock horror crime stories?  You people have a platform, you can reach the public, why not use it for good purposes sometimes?  Sigh, I know, I know, silly old fashioned r0b.  Most of the media exists not to inform, but to sell advertising.  It's just - the cost of our ignorance is going to be high...</p>

V<p>I've heard the State Services Commission are investigating their own demise, by looking into whether its functions should fold into the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Has anyone heard anything similar?</p>\u000A<p>If true, it would be an incredible power shift in favour of the office of the Prime Minister. And you have to wonder, does John Key simply want to extend his personal bullying capabilities even further?</p>

V<p>What a shame that the Reserve Bank has <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport" target="_blank">backed down</a> on new the prudential liquidity rules that require the banks to raise a higher percentage of their money from longer term deposits. The rules were to come in at the start of next year, but the banks complained and in this country business always get its way so the rules won't fully come in until 2012.</p>\u000A<p>The rules were designed to help protect banks from another credit crunch (which, by the way, German experts are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/6339144/German-Wise-Men-fear-credit-crunch-in-2010.html" target="_blank">already predicting</a> for next year) but a side-effect is forcing banks to raise more money domestically, rather than borrowing it from overseas, which would increase savings rates here and push up mortgage rates. These are both good things - we need to save more and borrow less, and we need to stop putting so much 'investment' into housing.</p>\u000A<p>The really clever thing about increasing interest rates this way is that it wouldn't have fuelled the 'carry trade' where people in countries with low interest rates borrow money to invest it in countries, like New Zealand, with comparatively high rates - this currency flow pushes up the currency hurting exporters. If anything, that would lower the interest rates the banks are willing to pay to borrow from overseas and they would have been borrowing less - all of which adds up to a (marginally) lower currency and a lower current account deficit.</p>\u000A<p>We can't keep borrowing ever more money from overseas to buy houses from each other. Forcing banks to borrow less from overseas and raise more domestically is an important step in that. It will help deflate the housing bubble, increase savings, lower the exchange rates, increase exports, and improve the current account deficit. What a pity the Reserve Bank lacks the courage to act when it's desperately needed.</p>

He gets his generous <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/English-shouldnt-get-a-cent/tabid/1135/articleID/121925/cat/924/Default.aspx">$276,000</a> salary.  For years he received his unjustified Wellington accommodation allowance. The <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10588724">rules were changed</a> so he could get an even bigger Wellington allowance as a Minister, but he got caught out and grudgingly paid that back.  Bill gets all his other perks and benefits, he gets a <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/audrey-young/news/article.cfm?a_id=164&objectid=10597838">free TV</a>, he gets his house cleaned at taxpayer's expense.  He even managed to find time in his busy schedule to make sure he <a href="http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/2009/09/30/docs-the-a-g-will-consider-who-could-i-possibly-be/">applied</a> for an extra <a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2009/09/23/bill\u2019s-office-cleaners-get-less-than-house-cleaner/">$20</a> per week for an extra hour's cleaning (that's some impressive attention to detail!).  He made good and sure he screwed every <b>last</b> penny out of the taxpayer. </p>\u000A<p>But Twenty Dollar Bill wants us to do as he says, not as he does.  Playing the rules to maximise your income simply isn't on <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2998145/Spotlight-to-fall-on-tax-dodgers">says Bill</a>:</p>\u000A<blockquote><p>Finance minister Bill English has signalled the government will next year get tough with tax-dodgers by closing loopholes that allow wage earners to avoid paying their share of tax.</p>\u000A<p>The IRD says the government is missing out on $300 million a year because of wage earners who squirrel away money into trust accounts to avoid paying the top income tax rate. More is lost because of earnings that are "sheltered" by a company created solely to avoid tax.</p>\u000A<p>The IRD, in its latest submission to the Tax Working Group, says the problem is that New Zealand's multitude of tax rates is encouraging bad behaviour.  It said the trust account and company tax rates were too far out of line with income tax rates. Taxpayers were placing income in a trust account, paying 33 cents for every dollar earned, rather than the top rate of 38c. Another common ploy was for individual taxpayers to "shelter" their money by creating a company so that they paid 30 cents of every dollar earned in tax rather than the top rate.<br />\u000A...<br />\u000AEnglish said large-scale "legitimate avoidance behaviour" by higher-income earners undermined the goodwill of lower-income earners.</p></blockquote>\u000A<p>This seems like a good initiative.  Close the loopholes that let people avoid paying their fair share of taxes while still "passing the legal test" (as Bill might put it).  Stop the abuse of trusts (how's the Endeavour trust doing Bill?).  That sort of thing.  But for blindingly obvious reasons Bill English has no credibility in making this call.  He screwed the taxpayer for every penny.  Any punter out there avoiding taxes will be inclined to ask what business Twenty Dollar Bill has telling them not to do the same...</p>
